14	This story grips you from the beginning, takes you on a journey and leaves you breathless. Nicolas Sparks never disappoints in his storytelling	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.076913	2018-11-08 21:45:55.076913

18	Another excellent Nicholas Sparks book really felt the characters pain and joy!	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.083006	2018-11-08 21:45:55.083006
19	Every Breath by Nicholas Sparks is a delightfully heartwarming and engaging romance.Thirty-six year old Hope Anderson retreats to her family’s beach cottage after another fight with her long time boyfriend Josh. The two have been dating off and on for the past six years and she is beginning to think he will never be ready to fully commit to her. Following their latest argument, their relationship is off yet again and Josh’s decision to go to Las Vegas with his friends instead of attending a wedding in North Carolina with Hope is quite disheartening. Unable to give up on her dreams of motherhood and marriage, Hope is hoping to work things out with Josh, but will meeting Tru Walls change the direction of her life?Tru has flown to the NC coast from Zimbabwe to meet his biological father for the first time. Tru is forty-two year divorced father and a wild life safari guide who spends the most of his time in the African bush.  Despite losing his mother in a tragic fire and a troubled relationship with his step-father and half-siblings, Tru is comfortable in his skin and content with his life. The only reason he agrees to meet his father is to hopefully glean information about his mother.  With his father’s arrival delayed, Tru  is enjoying his time on the beach when he  begins spending time with Hope.Hope and Tru do not have much time together but their relationship is intense and emotional. Having confided in one another, their burgeoning friendship quickly turns romantic although neither of them envision a future together. Despite the strength of her feelings for Tru, Hope cannot give up on her six year relationship with Josh. Tru’s life is in Zimbabwe with his son but he cannot let Hope leave without confessing his love to her. Will Hope and Tru find a way to be together?Every Breath is a wonderfully romantic novel that is fast-paced and compelling. Tru and Hope are terrific characters who are immensely appealing and completely lovable. The beach setting is quite picturesque and easy to visualize. The descriptions of Tru’s life in Zimbabwe bring the country vibrantly to life.  Nicholas Sparks opens and closes the story with very intriguing entries that are unique and clever. The novel’s deeply affecting conclusion is poignant yet uplifting. I absolutely loved and highly recommend this heartfelt and endearing novel to fans of the genre.I received a complimentary copy for review.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.084566	2018-11-08 21:45:55.084566
20	This was the very first audiobook that i listened to all the way through. At first I wasn’t sure how I would like it since the voice of Tru was so deep and the voice for Hope seemed a little on the valley girl side. But as I listened more they proved to be not at all what I thought but very fitting for the characters in this story. I believe I was just so used to hearing the voices in my head when I read as opposed to actually hearing other people’s impersonations of the character they have heard. Very well done by Vanessa Johansson and Sean Cameron Michael the narrators.I did not read the back of the book before diving in. I sadly have only read one other Nicholas Sparks book so far and have been wanting to read more for awhile now. What better way to dive in than with a NEW book! So without even knowing what this story was going to be about besides the usual location of North Carolina and being a love story I began to listen to the makings of another wonderful Nicholas Sparks creation.Tru Walls was a character that I grew to love very quickly. He was a very passionate man who showed that in all that he was, his choice of career, his love for his son, and the values he set forth in life. He was a calm and peaceful man who even as a reader was able to sense that calm and peaceful felling from the descriptions that Nicolas portrayed in his writing. He set off on his 1st trip to America to meet the father he had never known or never really cared to know. But having lost his mother at such a young age his curiosity about who she was drew him to meet his father when he received the letter and airplane ticket. Never did he think the trip to America would result in some of the best days of his life and the worst.Hope Anderson was stuck in a relationship that never seemed to be going the way she wanted. She was still not married and had no children. She dreamed of being a mother more than anything else. As her long term relationship took another “break” she decided to head to her family cottage on the beach to think about her life and where it was going. She never expected to fall in love with a stranger and then have to make the hardest decision in her life.Tru and Hope together were magical, a dream so many wish they encountered themselves.  The drew strength and comfort from each other.  True soulmates torn apart by dreams and family obligations.  Would these souls be kindred spirits in the end?I do not want to give away too much about this story but I will tell you that you may need a tissue or two to get through this book. Be prepared to be captivated by the workings of the master of love Nicholas Sparks. He truly has a way with words…making you swoon and breaking your heart all within 320 some odd pages.Congratulations Nicholas Sparks on another exceptional story!	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.08619	2018-11-08 21:45:55.08619
1	While preparing this review, I had to do just as I did while reading the novel – take breaks to let my emotions subside so I could see to read (or write), for a lot of emotions came to the fore. By the way, I strongly recommend adding the Audible Edition to your library at the reduced price of $9.47.Firstly, due to my own personal circumstances. My father, not long before he passed on eight years ago, had urged me to read and study Nicholas Sparks’s style of writing. Dad was not moved by many authors, so I noted that, but did not then do as he urged. In just the introduction to the novel, I quickly understood why Dad was so moved.Also, though, my first marriage was a story not so very different, in the essential ways, from the true story behind the novel. I, too, spent time in Africa (Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and I am convinced I shall one day return to that magical, awe-inspiring land).That employment in southern Africa became the beginning of the end of my first marriage, one of the consequences you pay while trying to deal with day-to-day challenges.Of course, had I not gone to Africa, thence, years later, to Egypt, I might never have suffered the divorce but would not have then discovered my wife of today, who is the Godsend that brought me back from the dead and failed.My point is, “Every Breath” by Nicholas Sparks opened up some old wounds BUT also healed them shut. For me, this story was epic. A life changer.BLUSH FACTOR: This love story is absent any profanities, but the love scenes, while drawing a clear, unmistakable picture, are not graphic in the sense of more risqué novels. Tantalizing? Yes, but not over-the-top graphic. Read first before deciding to read to anybody else, is the best advice I can give. Wonderful images beautifully written is another way to put it.ADVENTURE: There IS a definite sense of adventure.SOUL: Yes.CHARACTER OR VOICE: It is magical how this writer can open the story up to let it speak for itself.EDITING FOR GRAMMAR AND TYPOS: Professional editing of the highest order.THE WRITING FLOW & STYLE: I think it’s clear that this writer is moving in his narrative.POV: Third person, which works well for this story. We get to feel the emotions of the main characters so effectively due to the way point of view is used in this work.EXCERPT‘…time, she’d believed her dad to be the smartest man in the world. When she would tell him that, he’d always laugh and say that if that were true, then he would have figured out a way to earn a million dollars. Her mom was a teacher, too—second grade—and it wasn’t until Hope graduated from college and began paying her own bills that she realized how much of a financial challenge it must have been for them to raise a family, even on their combined income.Her dad had been a coach to the high school’s cross country and track teams as well. He never raised his voice, but nonetheless led his teams to numerous conference championships. Along with her sisters, Hope had participated in both sports all four years of high school, and though none of them were stars, Hope still jogged a few times a week. Her older sisters ran three or four days a week, and for the past ten years, Hope had joined her dad and her sisters at the annual Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving morning, all of them working up an appetite before sitting down at the table. Two years earlier, her dad had won his age-group bracket.But now, her dad would never run again.It had started with occasional twitches and a slight, if noticeable, fatigue. For how long, she wasn’t exactly sure, but she guessed that it had been a couple of years. In the twelve months after that, the runs in the woods became jogs, and then finally walks.Old age, his internist suggested, and it made sense. By then, her dad was in his late sixties—he’d retired four years earlier—and he had arthritis in his hips and feet. Despite a life of exercise, he took medication for slightly elevated blood pressure. Then, last January, he’d caught a cold. It was a normal, run-of-the-mill cold, but after a few weeks, her dad had still found it harder to breathe than usual.Hope had gone with him to another appointment with his internist. More tests were done. Blood work was sent to the labs. He was referred to another doctor, then another. A muscle biopsy was taken, and when the results came back, there was the suggestion of a potential neurological problem. It was at that point that Hope began to worry. More tests followed, and later, Hope sat with the rest of her family as the diagnosis of…’Sparks, Nicholas. Every Breath (Kindle Locations 465-481). Grand Central Publishing.

21	I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, and was excited when I got an early copy of his new release.  I really enjoyed the introduction to this story from the author and where he got his inspiration for this book.  I think I enjoyed this even more knowing a little about the back story and that it really based off true events.I do feel it was different than his other work.  It was not my favorite book I have read from the author, but it was still great.  I loved the story between True and Hope.  I liked learning about how they met, their life when they were apart, and especially when they come back together.  I think the mailbox at Kindred Spirit sounds amazing and a place I would love to visit one day.This was emotional at times when talking about the parents of both True and Hope.  I was waiting for the signature heart-wrenching moment that is in all of Nicholas Sparks books.  Although this was very sad at times, it just never hit that level that most of his books have in the past.  I know some people hate those, but I personally love that about his stories.  I was a little let down when it came to that.  Do not get me wrong, there were still several times your heart will break as you learn more about their story.Overall, this was an amazing and crazy love story.  I would never have guessed that this was a real story without knowing it from the beginning.  I really enjoyed it.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.087817	2018-11-08 21:45:55.087817
22	This book starts out with a dated letter from the author, stating that it is a true story that has been retold with things changed for privacy. Then you get to the end of the book, and he’s like, nope! This was just a work of fiction..... I really don’t know why he felt the need to write the book this way. Just write it like all your other books. It really made me angry.  With that being said, there was a big editing mistake, which I have attached as a photo- it was Hope, not Claire, getting her nails done for the wedding. Claire was the hair stylist.... I was really in to the book until near the end. (Spoilers!) I thought Hope was super selfish for choosing to stay with Josh who was obviously not marriage material to begin with- what women stays with a guy for 6 years who continually cheats on her? Just so she can have kids? I don’t get it. Then, I thought there was way too much story after she and Tru reunited. The book should’ve just ended- she turns around at the mailbox, sees him, they embrace, story over. Did she really need to be diagnosed with ALS?  I think Nicholas has this huge problem of needing to kill a character or have something otherwise horrible happen to them. That doesn’t equate to a good story. I felt like this book was being written in a way to be turned in to a movie later. That’s not why you should write a book. I read the book in one day, and I waited a whole day to write this review. My feelings haven’t changed. I guess he will never make a book as good as the notebook again. Why do I keep buying them? Too predictable.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.089616	2018-11-08 21:45:55.089616
23	EVERY BREATH by Nicholas Sparks is a stand alone love story focusing on forty-two year divorced father and safari tour guide Tru Walls, and thirty-six year old, trauma nurse Hope Anderson.Told from third person perspectives EVERY BREATH takes the reader back to the year 1990 focusing on one week in the life of forty-two year divorced father and African safari tour guide Tru Walls, and thirty-six year old, trauma nurse Hope Anderson.  Tru Walls, a safari guide born and raised in Zimbabwe, has come to America in search of answers about his mother and her past. Meeting trauma nurse Hope Anderson stirred something deep within our story line hero, something he would always remember including the love for a woman who was torn between head and heart. Fast forward to 2014 wherein Tru will reconnect with the woman he has never stopped loving only to discover she has never stopped loving him in return.Divided into two parts (1990 and 2014) EVERY BREATH is a story based in reality brought about by a journal and letters found in an isolated mailbox called Kindred Spirit near the dunes of Sunset Beach, North Carolina.  The mailbox, belonging to everyone and no one, is a treasury of love letters from the lost; stories of then and now; a place for dreams and happily ever afters to live on when someone dies.  Nicholas Sparks uses artistic license to spin a love story spanning decades focusing on two people whose lives went in opposite directions eventually meeting to form their own happily ever after. Reflective in nature EVERY BREATH reconnects with the past revealing twenty-plus years of pain, heartache, failures and success eventually meandering back to Sunset Beach where it all began.An imaginative, heart breaking and emotional story line EVERY BREATH looks at love and loss; family and duty; reconnection, dreams, and hope. Uniquely Nicholas Sparks EVERY BREATH is a wonderful love story that will captivate and enchant as you reflect upon your own life of what ifs and whys. Every city and town should have their own ‘Kindred Spirit’ in the hopes of living on in the minds of others.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.091222	2018-11-08 21:45:55.091222
24	I listened to the audio book. As always, I loved Sparks' attention to detail, learning a bit about Africa, and the characters were great. Kinda pissed at Hope for her decision. I had to suspend my disbelief that they fell in love so quickly (and so deeply) as they did in just a couple days, but that's the nature of fiction so it's not really a complaint.  (P.S.: the narrators were great!)	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09279	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09279
25	This is a  fantastic book. I don't know how Sparks comes up with these amazing stories. I've  read all his books and there all great, but I have several favorites. This book is my 2nd  favorite.  My 1st favorite is 3 weeks with my brother which is nonfiction. I loved this book the whole way through, the ending was the best and actually made the book extra special. I believed. You see what you think..	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09436	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09436
26	Could not get over the narrator terrible. Story was taking too long to get to the point of the book. Gave up on chapter 5	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09594	2018-11-08 21:45:55.09594
27	This book was great from start to finish! Unexpected twists, lots of love and a few tears too!	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.097433	2018-11-08 21:45:55.097433
28	Every Breath seriously needs an editor. There is so much “tell” and not enough “show” that the story moves at a glacial pace, compounded by an overreliance on long inner monologues. I grabbed Every Breath on a whim because my sister-in-law raves about The Notebook. I had not read any books by Nicholas Sparks nor seen any movie made from his books, but I like a good romance. Every Breath came up as #1 on Amazon under Clean & Wholesome Romance. I was a bit surprised when I hit a sex scene at 47%. Now, normally this wouldn’t bother me, but here I am about halfway through the book and almost nothing has happened. At all.To be fair, there was a little action. A man drove to the airport and thought of the danger it would be if it were night. He flew to the US. A lady visited her parents’ cottage by the shore. They met on the beach. They met at a restaurant. They talked a bit. They inhabited slow scenes with lots of inner monologues, lots of descriptions, and virtually no action. Finally something happened! These two people who have known each other about two days, I think (sorry, lost track with all the inner ramblings), are now madly in love and jumping into bed. I think he ate some olives in there somewhere. Did they eat their dinner that she was chopping veggies for? I was so bored I can't remember.The woman is trying to assess her six-year relationship with the man she loves because he’s so perfect; she intends to marry him and have the children she’s been yearning for as soon as they get over this rough spot in their relationship. The man she’s just met has no intentions of ever marrying, is sterile and can’t have kids, is a lone wolf who loves his solitary life with the exception of missing his son (begotten before he was sterile, sorry for any confusion there). And suddenly these two acquaintances know that they are deeply in love with each other. They knew upon seeing each other (she’s beautiful; his butt looks nice in tight jeans) how incredible their connection is. They share a few stories and a dinner and are now presumably rocking toward happily ever after. Or at least, the bedroom.Something must happen in the last half of the book, but I don’t really care. I’m so bored and irritated with the overkill on inner monologues, the plodding pace, plus the hackneyed instalove cliché, that my eye rolls gave me a headache. (Confession: it was the frustration with the story that gave me the headache, not the eye rolling.) Every Breath is a DNF for me.ETA: Another reviewer said they read the entire book and in the author note at the end, Nicholas Sparks admits the entire premise of the book is a lie. The book is NOT based on a true story. That's despicable, imo. Before buying the book, I read the intro as part of the sample, I double-checked that that the author had signed and dated the intro, just as authors do for true introductory notes, and I had checked that the Kindred Spirit mailbox is real (it is). I did all that because I wanted to make sure it was based on a true story before I read it. That premise drew me to the book. To find out the whole intro is a dramatic fabrication, a literary device, makes me glad that I didn't finish the book and find that at the end. Nicholas Sparks deliberately played and manipulated us readers with that intro. Not cool.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.098802	2018-11-08 21:45:55.098802
29	The first half of the book was promising, but unfortunately it then became a boring '"tell" with not enough "show."  Conversation during their first restaurant dinner was yawn- worthy with predictable questions and answers.  Nicholas Sparks writing sex scenes?  Made me cringe. Maybe he was trying to breathe some life into this dull narrative.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.100599	2018-11-08 21:45:55.100599
30	My wife has read every N Sparks books. Her first day and she said she "had to slow her reading so it will last". I think she likes it. Since today was day one, I haven't got her feed back on the book as a whole. But I do know she had a hard time putting it down. She could have read it one day, but she chooses to take her time with it.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.102076	2018-11-08 21:45:55.102076
31	I have loved all the books by Nicholas Sparks and although this one has some good pages it was a  bit of a disappointment. It jumped around and there were big gaps of time ignored. Hope his next one is better.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.103728	2018-11-08 21:45:55.103728

36	When I read in the prologue that this novel was based on a true story, I wondered if it would live up to my expectations. I need not have worried; Nicholas Sparks worked his magic to spin a tale that seemed to flow effortlessly onto the page.A love story woven together with magic, destiny, hearthache, and hope that will likely keep you enchanted for hours at a time.	\N	430	2018-11-08 21:45:55.111082	2018-11-08 21:45:55.111082

53	Such a good book! I'm an adult. Like, grown. I am also a fan of Harry Potter and Tahereh Mafi, which I read as a child through college, and last year, respectively. To be fair, I buy books 'for my niece' and read them quickly before I give them to her as gifts so we can discuss them together - an activity I enjoy immensely. As a black woman who loves the fantasy genre, Adeyemi is my new hero for creating a world that draws its richness and depth from West Africa. We have a class of oppressed people who have gifts that the oppressors are afraid of - a theme so relevant to life today as a Diasporan in America. I remember reading an article that spoke of implicit bias and the belief that some people have that black people are magical and have almost super-human strength, and that those were seen as reasons to justify fear of black bodies. Adeyemi throws that on its head, and I can't wait to read (and see!) what happens next in Orïsha, and I can't wait to hear what my niece thinks of the book! #blackgirlmagic	{"text": "Such a good book!

54	Let me list the things I loved about this book:The characters are divine.I LOVED the different perspectives. Every one of them. Zélie is the perfect protagonist because she’s vibrant and projects real vulnerabilities and a ferocity that’s easy to identify with and root for. Amari is a gem and a sweetheart and her character’s growth was my favorite of the three leads. And Inan, he was the most compelling character for me since he’s so tragic, with his conflicted beliefs and destructive actions. Aside from the leads, there are many secondary characters that pulled me into the story. Zélie’s brother is a hero and a true prince and I would’ve loved a few scenes from his perspective. The king is a great villain, and I enjoyed reading about his backstory. Actually, I loved reading about all the characters’ backstories and how their stories were connected to Orïsha. My only complaint, and it’s a tiny one, is that there were a few characters who...left too soon and I would’ve loved more scenes with them. But hell, it’s the first book in a YA series and already 525 pages so everyone couldn’t have gotten a POV, right?The story gripped me and the pace thrilled me.I found CBB to be a quickly paced read bursting with action (and violence!) and magic. The chapters are relatively short, and each and every scene grabbed my attention. Seriously, every one. There isn’t excessive world building which I loved since I think it helped the story move along at a pace that matches the urgency of the stakes the characters face. I had to force myself to slow down and savor it, and I still felt like it ended too soon when it was over. Not to say there aren’t a few quiet moments, because there are, and I loved those moments since they allowed me to get to know the characters and for the characters to know each other. (Loved those dream sequences!)The message and themes are profound and universal.This is a story about fear and intolerance and how that leads to violence and oppression. Orïsha is a fractured nation with a horrific past, and a hopeless future for too many who live without freedom. This is a fantasy land, but it’s clear it draws from real life atrocities that occur daily in the world around us and that allows this novel to have weight. The stakes are high, and the trauma is real and personal. It’s also a story about faith and believing in a power greater than yourself. It’s about believing in people and how we’re all connected as one. Yes, it tackles some tough and distressing issues, and the characters experience so much pain and strife, but there is hope and there is love and moments of joy and humor.There’s also romance.Though it’s not the central theme of the novel, and when you look at the novel it doesn’t take up much space, there is romance for a few characters. One romantic plot is intense and fast, and the other is more slow burning, but they both added depth to the story and softer layers to the world filled with terror and rage. It also provided sweetness and relief from the urgency to succeed in their quest.The more intense romance could potentially be unsatisfying for a few readers since its intensity builds quickly over a short span of time. For me, I loved it for the way it unfolded and how—I’m trying not to give too much away—the author uses the magic to allow these characters to connect on a deeper level than would be possible in a different setting.The other romantic plot line didn’t delve as deeply into the characters’ feelings, but there’s much room to grow for that love story and I’m so excited to see how it plays out.The possibilities...They’re endless, and I’m sure they’ll be torturous. This is the first in a series, so it’s not a spoiler to say it ends with a cliffhanger, and I’m so happy to say it ends on one of the better cliffhangers that I’ve read. The journey that these characters travel throughout the story does climax in the final chapter, but it’s the type of bang that is really a beginning. I have re-read the epilogue a few times and my mind is dizzy with different possibilities. I’m going down so many different roads, and my excitement continues to build because I just know the next book is going to be amazing. It must be—this world is amazing. I want more. I WANT MORE.CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE is all that I hoped it would be. It’s all that I hoped it would be. How often does that happen? It’s a wonderful feeling.	{"text": "Let me list the things I loved about this book:The characters are divine.I LOVED the different perspectives. Every one of them.

56	As I recover from binge-reading this book, a few words circle around in my brain: this book was amazing. Not only does it have magic, complex characters, and a cause many of us can relate to, but it also has amazing world-building and a plot that will pull at your heartstrings.A quick summary of the world: Orïsha is a country where magic used to roam. The kosidán, those without magic, were afraid of the maji’s power, and as such waged war against them. But as long as the maji had power, they were able to keep the kosidán at bay. Until Saran, a zealous king, figured out a way to break off the connection the maji had with the gods. Then Saran ordered all of the maji killed—sparing the ibawi (those who cannot yet do magic but will be able to once they turn 13) since they were not trained in the ways of magic.This is where the story comes in. It’s been eleven years since magic disappeared from the world, and Zélie is treated like a maggot—a derogatory term for Divîners, those who were born with white hair and the ability to do magic (although magic no longer exists). She gets thrown into a quest to bring magic back, but is almost thwarted at every turn by the king’s forces.Zélie is everything I want in a protagonist. She’s stubborn, smart, empathetic, and has got flaws. Adeyemi’s writing makes her such a relatable character, with a backstory that drives her to succeed in her mission. I love getting to know her and I love that she’s not perfect. There are a lot of books out there where the hero is always right and never really doubts themselves and Zélie isn’t like that. She reads like a human being, with real inner and outer struggles. She’s lost so much and that makes her even more compassionate towards others. She doesn’t hesitate to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves and it’s that strength and stubbornness that gets her into trouble, but also makes her a kind soul. She’s also super quick with her comebacks and a little snarky, which adds some lightness that is needed.Zélie isn’t the only one with a backstory. The main antagonist, Inan, isn’t pure evil. Because of the rotating POVs, we get to see his struggle—his inner monologue—and we get to, while not relate, at least understand why he’s making the choices he’s making. I am not one for the “pure evil” villain, and Inan is certainly not one of those. While I don’t always agree with Inan’s choices, I can’t truly hate him because I see what drives him. His intentions are mostly pure, and he does care about his people. He just tries to protect them in a way that ends up hurting most of his people. (His dad, Saran, doesn’t seem to care for the Divîners at all and doesn’t hesitate to hurt anyone with magical abilities).I absolutely loved seeing Amari grow. While I didn’t really feel a connection with her in the beginning, the way she grew into herself made me smile and really proud. I loved it when she chose to stay and fight for what she believed right, even if it meant going against her family. Towards the end we got to see more of her and a little bit more of how she stepped up into her role as an active fighter against injustice. While in the beginning a lot of her choices were made in the heat of the moment, we see her own up to her choices and choose to stay in the fight to get magic back. There’s a scene towards the end where she helps Zélie through a traumatic event, and it makes me really happy that she took her experiences and turned them into a way she could help Zélie heal. Amari and Zélie’s friendship is my favorite relationship in this book because while they didn’t start out as friends, they bonded because of their experiences and were able to truly understand each other.Zélie’s brother, Tzain, is the only one of the four main characters that doesn’t have a POV in the story. But even so, I really enjoyed reading scenes with him in it. He’s compassionate and really cares for his sister, and will do anything to protect her, even if it means getting the aftermath of his sister’s choices. His role is the protector in the book, and it’s hard for him to do what he wants because he’s driven by his need to take care of his family. His relationship with Zélie is most definitely a sibling relationship, because even though they fight, they are still willing to die for each other.(And I can’t forget Nailah—Zélie’s Lionaire! I loved that animal!)Adeyemi’s world-building was off-the-charts amazing. Her world’s mythology—influenced by Yoruba culture—was beautiful and I truly loved the stories of how magic came to be. Her writing sucked me in and had me flipping the pages to find out what happened. The plot is so smooth and a lot of people aren’t merely good or evil. Most of the time you can see why certain characters acted the way they did, and it’s that writing that made me love the book.Adeyemi’s book is absolutely beautiful and I recommend it to people who love good world-building, magic, coming-of-age stories, and complex characters. This book not only has amazing writing, but it’s got fully fleshed-out characters that you can relate to.	{"text": "As I recover from binge-reading this book, a few words circle around in my brain: this book was amazing. Not only does it have magic, complex characters, and a cause many of us can relate to, but it also has amazing world-building and a plot that will pull at your heartstrings.A quick summary of the world: Orïsha is a country where magic used to roam. The kosidán, those without magic, were afraid of the maji’s power, and as such waged war against them. But as long as the maji had power, they were able to keep the kosidán at bay. Until Saran, a zealous king, figured out a way to break off the connection the maji had with the gods.

58	This book is a West African fantasy that takes place in the land of Orïsha.  At first I wasn't sure how I would like this book since it got so much hype but it was certainly worth all the hype it did get. Despite how long it was the writing was amazing.  To me it felt like the pace of the story was fast paced. This stories has three different point of views.  I enjoyed the characters in this story, Zelie is such a fierce warrior. I also loved that Zelie and Amari who are very tough women.They were two people who should have been enemies. Amari is the daughter of the King and thankfully, she  is nothing like her tyrant father.  They live in a land that use to thrive on magic.  But now the king of Orïsha wants to make sure magic is kept dead. They constantly keep the reminder that the Diviners are lesser so that they won't remember how powerful they were. This is one book you defiantly want to pick up and read.	{"text": "This book is a West African fantasy that takes place in the land of Orïsha.

59	*** 5+++ Stars!!! ***THIS BOOKTHIS! BOOOOK!!!Absolutely magnificent. This book was pure magicTomi Adeyemi has already achieved greatness and she's on her way to so much more!! She has been compared to extremely accomplished authors and this book was picked up to be adapted into film BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED!!! Oh, and did I mention she also signed a 7-figure book deal all at the age of 23?Children of Blood and Bone tells the story of a young girl named Zélie who goes on a quest to bring magic back to Orïsha with the help of her brother, Tzain, and the princess of Orïsha, Amari. The king of Orïsha has a strong hatred for maji and once ordered everyone who possessed magic to be killed, including Zélie's mother. Add in the fact that the king sends his son and future king, Inan to go after the three and the task of bringing magic back seems almost impossible.Every paragraph was rich, filled with soul and devastatingly beautiful. I had to stop reading so many times just to express my love for Ms. Adeyemi's writing!!! YA Fantasy needs more exciting books like this! I can't wait to read more from this author. When I was a teenager, Harry Potter was the biggest and most popular book and movie series. I believe the Legacy of Orïsha series will be just as popular among today's teens. This series is going to be the next cultural phenomenon and I can't wait to see Tomi Adeyemi achieve more and more much deserved success.Important topics were also brought up in this novel such as colorism and police brutality among the Black community."You're people, your guards- they're nothing more than killers, rapists, and thieves. The only difference between them and criminals is the uniforms they wear"My heart ached for Zélie and her people. Knowing that how the maji were treated is all too real for Black people made it that much more painful. The maji were hated, oppressed, sometimes enslaved, and even killed because of the prejudice against them. This book is so important and I can't imagine what Adeyemi felt as she wrote it.The characters and their development was outstanding. One of my favorite aspects of this novel was the friendship between Zélie and Amari."I rest my forehead against hers, and we sit in a comfortable silence, translating our love though touch. The Princess and the Warrior, I decide in my head. When they tell the story of tomorrow, that is what they shall call it."Two young girls, who the world believes should hate each other, threw prejudice aside and a heartwarming friendship blossomed. Seeing these two girls share something so pure amidst so much hatred and danger filled me with hope and love."I want you to be happy, Zél. More than you realize."This is a book that everyone needs to read regardless of whether or not you enjoy this genre, or even enjoy reading at all. I seriously cannot get over how much I loved this book and these characters!!By the end of this novel, I had tears in my eyes and I kept praying, just one more chapter! Ms. Adeyemi has created a masterpiece and I will be (very) impatiently waiting for book two in the series, Children of Virtue and Vengeance!	{"text": "*** 5+++ Stars!!! ***THIS BOOKTHIS!

60	WOW! Simply put, this book was just… DOPE! I was completely enthralled from the first page. I absolutely love the cover as it really helps you envision Zélie on her journey.Zélie’s family and many other families were ripped apart the day that King Saran decided that magic was evil and all maji should be slaughtered. That was the day that magic died and her mother was among the many victims to be slaughtered. From that day going forward, her people were treated terribly, some were enslaved and were called “maggots” in the land of Orïsha. She soon found out that it was her destiny to bring back magic to her people. With the help of her brother, Tzain, as well as Amari, the Princess who wants to right her fathers wrongs.  All the while, being followed by Prince Inan, brother of Amari. Soon enough, he discovers that he actually has a secret of his own that he doesn’t ever want to be revealed. Loyal to his father/King he is committed to his mission, he was tasked by his father to bring back Amari as well as Zélie while his soldiers destroy the villages. Eventually their paths will cross again – Will Inan see things the way that his sister, Amari, does? Will Zélie be able to bring back magic and end the oppression of which her people have endured?Zélie is such an inspiring and strong main character, her strength and determination gives her the sheer will that she needs to continue on her journey even when she isn’t completely sure of her ability to restore magic. The supporting characters, Amari, Tzain, Inan and even her leoponaire, Nailah, were so crucial to the story. You also get the POV of 3 characters, Zélie, Amari and Inan. Inan is so conflicted and unsure of his own moral standing with magic and he constantly struggles to always go by the words that his father has always drilled into his head, “Duty over Self”. I sympathized with Zélie over the betrayal that she encounters towards the end of the book and you’re left hoping for some closure between her and Inan (hopefully we’ll see this in the next book!)I have good and sad news…. first the sad news… the 2nd book in this series, “Children of Virtue and Vengeance (Legacy of Orisha)“, is not set to be released until 3/5/2019 (UGH SUCH A LONG WAIT! 😦 😦 ). But the good news…. is that Tomi Adeyemi is currently in talks with the team at Fox 2000 and Temple Hill Productions to start a possible production of getting this book on screen! While there are no concrete dates as of yet, I can’t wait to see this book come to life!All in all, I absolutely loved the new heights that this book has taken me to. I look forward to more of Tomi Adeyemi’s work in the future! Happy reading guys! 🙂 check out my full review at loveatfirstreadcom.wordpress.com	{"text": "WOW! Simply put, this book was just… DOPE!

It is unlike any of his other work, but it’s still funny and it’s still so so sad, but it’s also Green’s OWN struggle.Go read his interview with NYT and try to tell me you didn’t want to cry.And if I see even ONE “but it’s not like TFIOS” whiny review…….don’t get me started.Read this book.

62	I just finished reading it. And I am sitting here crying. I hated it. And I absolutely loved it.Now that you are utterly confused, read on if any one you love struggles with mental illness.I hated this book for a lot of reasons. I hated it because the characters in it bug the crap out of me. Worse than some of the more annoying people in my real life. I hated it because there are things stylistically I wanted from this author, because he is one of my favorite authors, and those things, stylistically, were not really there.I hate it because my greatest fear in life is of spiraling into uncontrollable mental illness, and the book puts you inside the head of someone who has a spiraling mental illness, and it does so with just an eerie amount of accuracy, and I don't want to be inside that spiral. It is too scary inside that spiral.And I hate this book most of all because some of the people I love most in life, people who truly own parts of my soul, live inside that spiral far too often, and it hurts deep down to be reminded of that. I don't like to read books that make me hurt. I usually avoid them at all costs. If I start one, and discover it is that kind of book, I don't often finish it.But this book is by John Green, with whom I have a relationship that is hard to explain. Because so much of the history minutiae I have memorized is from Crash Course videos, he is the voice inside my head when I think of history. He is much smarter than me, which I admire, and a phenomenal writer, which I envy. So I had to finish the book.I absolutely love this book because revealing your inner demons in such vivid reality is incredibly brave, and that makes him a hero in my eyes. John Green suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (which is not ever named in the book, but it is painted in horrifically detailed words throughout). People don't talk about mental illness enough, but here he is revealing his inmost self. And yes, it is him. He has been doing interviews about it and whatnot. The doctor the protagonist sees in the book is even similarly named to his own doctor, whom he thanks in the acknowledgements. John Green has a credibility with teenagers that is pretty hard to establish, and as a result, millions of teenagers are going to read this book. That might not seem a small thing, but it might mean that perhaps the world will understand mental illness just a little bit better. For that, John Green is my hero. Read at your own risk.And I am still crying.	{"text": "I just finished reading it. And I am sitting here crying. I hated it.

65	Ever since Turtles All the Way Down was announced, I’ve been looking forward to it. I can honestly say it did not disappoint and was totally worth the wait. My best friend shares some characteristics with Aza, particularly the health-related thought spirals. Because of this, I really identified with Daisy. In fact, I highlighted this quote and shared it with my best friend:“…What I want to say to you, Holmesy, is that yes, you are exhausting, and yes, being your friend is work. But you are also the most fascinating person I have ever known, and you are not like mustard. You are like pizza, which is the highest compliment I can pay a person.”That is exactly how I feel. It is work to have a best friend dealing with mental illness, but it’s totally and completely worth it.Unlike some of John Green’s other books, Turtles All the Way Down wasn’t overly heart in a blendery (the end is kind of heartbreaking, but not on a TFiOS or Looking for Alaska level). It was, however, raw and honest. I don’t think an author without OCD himself could’ve written those thought spirals and Aza’s actions to be so real. I highly recommend this book to YA fans and pretty much everyone else. It’s really an excellent book.	{"text": "Ever since Turtles All the Way Down was announced, I’ve been looking forward to it.

67	4.5/5⭐️Synopsis-Sixteen-year-old Aza never intended to pursue the mystery of fugitive billionaire Russell Pickett, but there’s a hundred-thousand-dollar reward at stake and her Best and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to investigate. So together, they navigate the short distance and broad divides that separate them from Russell Pickett’s son, Davis.Aza is trying. She is trying to be a good daughter, a good friend, a good student, and maybe even a good detective, while also living within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.In his long-awaited return, John Green, the acclaimed, award-winning author of Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars, shares Aza’s story with shattering, unflinching clarity in this brilliant novel of love, resilience, and the power of lifelong friendship.Review-John Green is not my favorite author. Probably not even in my top ten. I’ve read quite a few of his books and liked them well enough. I bought this book for my teenage son because he really enjoys John Green’s work. He read it and said he was slightly disappointed in it and it definitely wasn’t his favorite Green book. Given our differing views on his other books, I decided to give it a try. I have to say this is by far my very favorite of his books. I connected with the main character probably more than I have any other. His portrayal of her mental illness was so spot on. And while I don’t have exactly the issues she does, I really connected with the parts of her suffering from anxiety and depression. The feelings of selfishness because it seems like everything has to revolve around you and your mental illness. The plot of searching for the fugitive did seem to stall out sometimes for me or seem a bit contrived, but the story didn’t even really need all of that. I found the story of Aza to be completely compelling without all of that. Just reading about her relationships and her struggle to try to be as normal as possible. I don’t cry reading many books but this one definitely had me tearing up. I definitely recommend giving this book a try.	{"text": "4.5/5⭐️Synopsis-Sixteen-year-old Aza never intended to pursue the mystery of fugitive billionaire Russell Pickett, but there’s a hundred-thousand-dollar reward at stake and her Best and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to investigate.

68	This novel portrays the social world of a high school junior who happens to be burdened with intrusive thoughts. The book provides an entertaining plot while also educating the reader about mental illness by narrating in first person the internal ruminations of a 16-year-old girl, Aza Holmes, who wrestles with obsessive thought spirals while also navigating the usual teenage preoccupations and struggles with dating, fretting about college, calming her overbearing mother, and appeasing her demanding best friend.The story is built around the premise of a news story that has recently been broadcast. A local billionaire has disappeared prior to a police raid on his house to arrest him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is offered for information about his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy, remembers that Aza knows this guy's son, and she has the thought that maybe they can get the reward by reconnecting with the son to gather information that can be used to track down the missing billionaire.It's true Aza does know his son. She'd met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire's son, lost his mother. So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the two feel a kinship of broken souls bonding. A sweet, conventional love story commences.But it hits a bitter-sweet, unconventional obstacle. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking because of all those microbes. “I'm not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains about her condition. Still they bond. Meanwhile Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’ father's disappearance. But the real question in the mind of the reader is, how does this story end for Aza's relationship with Davis?The book contains numerous descriptions of what it's like to live with intrusive thoughts. The following is an example:(BEGINNING OF EXCERPT)Thoughts are just a different kind of bacteria, colonizing you. I thought about the gut-brain information axis. Maybe you’re already gone. The prisoners run the jail now. Not a person so much as a swarm. Not a bee, but the hive.(END OF EXCERPT)The above and many other uses of metaphor in this book attempt to describe the internal turmoil inside the mind of a person with an OCD diagnosis. Aza is self-conscious about her perception of not being a "normal" person even though her psychiatric therapist repeatedly says, "That's not unusual."This book is marketed as young-adult genre but there's plenty of material here for adults to learn both about mental health and the world of social media, texting, and face time. In today's world it is realistic to expect a young savvy online snooper to be able to track down a missing person faster than the police.As it turns out in the end, they do indeed find the billionaire father (sort of), but Aza's relationship is such that she lets Davis make the decision whether to pass the information on to the police. And also the reader will want to know if their relationship continues in the end in spite of Aza's chronic OCD symptoms. The ending is realistic, not a fairytale, which is why it makes a good book for young people to read.	{"text": "This novel portrays the social world of a high school junior who happens to be burdened with intrusive thoughts.

71	Cynic that I am, with a finely-tuned Inner Critic always on high alert, it is often difficult to relax and read a book for pure pleasure, falling into the story, walking beside the characters, feeling their sun on my arms, their cold rain on my shoulders, and their emotions reaching deep and catching hold.  When it happens, though, I treasure the experience, and for days, sometimes weeks afterward, I regret my return to the less-than-magical, the more mundane, and too frequently, the patently awful, books on offer.A glowing review by a friend whose opinion I generally respect enticed me to try this book, one which is really not the type I would select.  But I was interested in the North Carolina setting and the premise of a “wild child” living alone in the marshes.  So off I went, nose in my Kindle.I read the book in two days, reading late into the night, snatching time during the day between work and chores.  Actually, the chores fell by the wayside, except for feeding my puppies.  I was mesmerized, enchanted, wrung out, appalled, energized, and amazed.  I dislike that last, overused word, but sometimes it’s the one that works.  And when I finished, I knew this was a book I’d read again, several times, and would not easily forget.What made it so special to me?  First, the writing: effortless, flowing, lyrical, and clear.  I absorbed it without stumbling, without mentally substituting a better word, or revising sentence structure.  Nope.  It was perfect for the tale being told.Second, Kya: a child of wonder, pain, abuse, abandonment, determination, beauty, the sort more from within than without, and a resourcefulness most of us cannot imagine.  Kya’s no cliché, no feral child just waiting to be rescued and rehabbed by well-meaning but clumsy individuals.  She transcends those stereotypes by leaps and bounds, and when she chooses to interact with others, she does so on her own terms. I also found the transformation, subtle and something easily missed if you’re not paying attention, of Kya’s speech patterns as she grew up, losing the backwoods twang and limited vocabulary of her crazy and largely uneducated father, for an almost academic style resulting from the stacks and stacks of books she devoured.Third, the setting: marshes that are hardly the monochromatic sweeps of green and blue so favored by weekend painters to the tourist trade; lagoons swarming with color and critters; birds far more numerous and varied than the ubiquitous seagulls; fireflies [although North Carolina folks call them lightnin’ bugs] flickering on and off with their special mating codes above the marsh; mud that isn’t yucky but the habitat of insects and worms; and the ocean, the largest body of all, rolling on past the undulating marsh grasses, the switchback creeks, placid lagoons, and sugar-soft strips of sand.  You can see all this, feel it in the blistering heat of summer and the chill moist fog of autumn and winter, smell the briny sharpness and the unmistakable tang of marsh mud at low tide, and hear the calls of all the birds, the waves rustling and then crashing, the wind making dead grass clatter.  And what about taste?  Well, there are all those grits, seeming years of grits…As always, other folks have provided the obligatory precis of the story, so go read those.  I’ll simply say that the plot is not trite, it’s not one you could predict, or want to, I suspect.  Neither are the characters in addition to Kya, even though one or two wear the clothes of a cliché until they morph into something else.Now here is the true evidence of this book’s power for me: I found some jarring elements, me, the reader who demands absolute historical, social, and geographical accuracy, and I just didn’t care. But here goes.The crawdads of the title are freshwater creatures, so they would not be denizens of Kya’s briny/saltwater marshes.  No one in North Carolina would call them anything but crawfish; growing up in Raleigh, I played with crawfish in creeks and streams.  Crawdad is a name used by folks west of the Appalachians.  However, crawdads do indeed sing, according to Woody Guthrie.People who live along the coast in North Carolina small towns would never go shopping can’t in Asheville.  True, you could drive from Manteo on the Outer Banks to Murphy in the state’s western tip using US Highway 64 the entire way, but it would have taken some 12 hours in the.  Thus the references to Asheville as a destination for shopping struck a wrong note.  So did having Kya’s meeting with her publisher in Greenville.  People flying in from Big Cities Up North would have landed in Raleigh or Charlotte.  Greenville didn’t have an airport in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Finally, I can’t find but one, possibly two, spots along the Atlantic coastline where Kya’s marsh sanctuary could have been located, given the detailed descriptions of boating through creeks and lagoons to the ocean.  That did make me wonder if the author used her imagination without the assistance of a few topographical maps.But you know what?  These minor quibbles aren’t worth a star, or even the point of a star to me, who is from NC, or to anyone else.  Such is the beauty and power of this story.	{"text": "Cynic that I am, with a finely-tuned Inner Critic always on high alert, it is often difficult to relax and read a book for pure pleasure, falling into the story, walking beside the characters, feeling their sun on my arms, their cold rain on my shoulders, and their emotions reaching deep and catching hold.

72	This is one of the most moving, caring, emotional novels I have ever read.  I read this book only because I had met Delia and have read her wildlife books she wrote with husband Mark Owens.  After starting the book this was all I could think about for days.  Kya's life become part of mine and the characters ceased to live on the page... they were alive with me and I was in the marsh, feeling every feather - the air, creatures and the plants.  Jumpin' became a trusted friend and so many moments touched my very soul.  I should not have been surprised as Delia has a great style in her wildlife books that I love to read.  But a novel like this is not my normal read.  Maybe I need to now reconsider what I choose as this book stopped me cold and made me rethink a lot that happened in my life.  Delia touched the human soul with her behavioral descriptions.  She is not only a respected wildlife scientist, she is a human behaviorist and understands more about the human condition that just about anyone else I know.  This is a tremendous treasure of a book and I'm sure it's staying in my read again list for a long time.  Highly recommend the book.	{"text": "This is one of the most moving, caring, emotional novels I have ever read.

77	Let me start by saying that this is the first review I have ever given.  I am a voracious reader and have over 5,000 books in my library.  I read fiction, non fiction, political, bios, horror, true crime, and everything in between.  I saw this book recommended on some magazine publication review, do not remember which one.  The plot sounded like something I might be interested in with intrigue, mystery, murder, and love.  I will admit that the narration of nature in the swamp and marsh does get a little redundant but  if you get past that you will find a book with a narrative hard to put down. You will feel compassion for the main character like you may have never felt before.  This book brought me to tears at the end.  I  recommended it as  a "must read" .  I don't think you will walk away not remembering KYA for a long time.	{"text": "Let me start by saying that this is the first review I have ever given.

78	What a book for the senses!  After finishing it, I’m still so full of sights, smells, tastes, emotions; I think it will stay with me for a long, long time.  It’s a beautiful, incandescent story written with lyrical prose that weaves seamlessly from the past to the current time in which the story is set.  I was completely immersed in a marsh in North Carolina and didn’t want the story to end.  The ending...didn’t see it coming.  Just...wow.

80	This book had so many fantastic reviews. I was looking forward to reading it but quickly became disillusioned. I'm from NC and have never heard anyone talk with the type of accents Ms. Owens chose for her characters. It seems like a small thing but it was extremely distracting, and eventually became ridiculous, especially because the characters somehow switched back and forth between speaking like Mark Twain's Jim to perfect English. It made me wonder if the author has ever been to our fair state. The story was good enough, albeit predictable, and it's obvious the author did her research on marsh life. I learned quite a few wildlife facts that were interesting. The conversations just kept me wrinkling up my nose with distaste and I ended the book on a sour note.	{"text": "This book had so many fantastic reviews.

88	I love John Grisham books and was anxious to read his latest work.  The characters are nicely drawn andyou are pulled into the story and want to keep reading to see how it turns out.  Because it’s John Grisham, you expect some kind of twist or unique reveal that will be the payout for investing so heavily in his characters and their dilemmas.  Unfortunately the book is predictable and leaves you disappointed.  The big secret turns out to be what you expected all along and you feel that it doesn’t ring true to the noble-ness of the main character.  In the end you are left with some enjoyment but not the kind of satisfaction that would make you recommend the book to everyone you know who loves to read.	{"text": "I love John Grisham books and was anxious to read his latest work.

108	I love the thought of John Grisham and his rich Southern characters and the beginning of his books with the anticipation of a very good story.  Then it plods along and instead of developing characters and story it just dies a slow death with an ending that is abrupt or just boring.  I vowed not to read him again after The Confession which just made me mad that I wasted my time.  Obviously, I gave him another chance.. No spoiler alert except to tell readers, yes, you do finally find out the motive but by the time you get to it,  you know nothing could be as bad to justify all the suffering it caused. The best part of the book was the description of the Bataan Death March which was richly woven and worth the read... thus the 3 stars.	\N	483	2018-11-08 21:46:42.91033	2018-11-08 21:46:42.91033
109	If you love John Grisham's courtroom suspense, this book will disappoint you.  The pace is glacial and the unimportant details are endless.  The "mystery" is set up in the first chapter and not answered until the end.  I kept hoping the answer would be a surprise in spite of the heavy foreshadowing.  It was not a surprise.  The overall theme is that a WWII war hero is a slave to his masculine code, even when it will ruin the lives of every important person in his life.  A modern mind already rejects the early 20th century masculine code as paternalistic, unreasonable and ultimately selfish.  This book will set that opinion in stone.	\N	483	2018-11-08 21:46:42.911825	2018-11-08 21:46:42.911825
110	The sudden appearance of William Faulkner within these pages simply confirms that what you are reading is Southern Gothic or perhaps Greek tragedy.A proud white Mississippi family is rocked b an act of premeditated murder. The actor however is the family patriarch, a war hero who returns to his farm, wife and children after being reported dead along the Bataan Death March. Instead, after escaping he joins Philippine and American guerrillas fighting the Japanese. So he is a war hero, whose return from the presumed dead thrills his family and hIs hometown.Yet when this prosperous farmer kills the Methodist minister in cold blood, the tragedy begins to unfold.John Grisham is not Willam Faulkner but he displays an ability to wrap a narrative with dark foreboding elements. This is no little feat. And The Reckoning discloses a side of Grisham only hinted before.	\N	483	2018-11-08 21:46:42.913278	2018-11-08 21:46:42.913278
2	I have always loved Nicholas Sparks' books. I have read them all and they have each made me cry, feel different emotions, and wish the books would never end. This book made my heart hurt and burst! The power of knowing that this love story is true and really out there and the pool of love can come together through anything. At the end knowing Hope's secret devastated me but in the same breath made me feel that Tru is her real love. I am in awe as to how Sparks could write their story with his own words and capture how they had to have been feeling so Well!

45	Nicholas Sparks has given us another great romance set at the beach in North Carolina. This was a light book with themes of love and sadness and hope for the future.

When Hope and Tru meet, sparks fly and they fall in love over a matter of days. When they have to make a choice between personal happiness and family responsibilities, it's devastating for both of them. Will they ever meet again and if they do, will their love survive over the year?This was an enduring, heart-warming novel that will have you believe that love can conquer all and last a life time.	{"text": "Nicholas Sparks has given us another great romance set at the beach in North Carolina.

51	After hearing Tomi's interview on NPR I ordered the book immediately,  My 11-year-old daughter grabbed it upon arrival.

At two in the morning I woke to lights on.  She hadn't stopped reading!  We talked this morning about it and her favorite word to use was "WOW."  She is in love with the heroine (a young girl) who fights for her beliefs without fear.  When I told my kiddo that she might want to think about how this story is somewhat of an analogy to race relations in America her eyes went wide (and I got another "wow).  "Mom, that's true! Ok - now I have to go finish it this morning....."Thank you Tomi for bringing a story to my family that has so many levels:  strong female characters, a worthy struggle, and a clear method of analogy to discuss the difficulties of race in our country.	{"text": "After hearing Tomi's interview on NPR I ordered the book immediately,  My 11-year-old daughter grabbed it upon arrival. \\"Mom - this is the exact book my librarian recommended to me just yesterday!\\" (So, I get mom points for being \\"in the know.\\")  She started reading it before bed.

52	I have been anticipating Children of Blood and Bone since I heard about it last fall. I was a little worried that I would be disappointed because I was looking forward to it so much. I finished it this morning and if anything, I was too reserved in my excitement. It is exactly the kind of sweeping fantasy that I love, and it has so many layers that give it much deeper meaning. I hate spoilers, so all I will say about the plot is that I love Tomi Adeyemi’s choices and where she took each of the characters. Unless you’ve seen or read interviews with the author, it’s important read the author’s note at the end of the book, which gives the story a modern context. That context makes the story even more meaningful. I really enjoyed her writing, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book. Even when things seemed to be going well, I felt like I couldn’t let my guard down, which is surely intentional.I love that women were central to the story, and I appreciate the way that the relationship between Zélie and Amari developed. It is an empowering story on many levels. I don't think I've ever read a fantasy or science fiction book where ALL the characters were Black, and I tried to make sure I pictured the characters as the author intended, occasionally catching myself and having to re-draw a character in my head.As someone who pretty much never re-reads a book, I will be reading this one again. And of course, I am already anticipating the sequel. I can’t wait to find out what happens and I'm hoping we get to meet more of the different clans. I also really hope they get the movie right, because it could be amazing on the big screen.I've read some pretty good books in the past year, but this is without a doubt my favorite.	{"text": "I have been anticipating Children of Blood and Bone since I heard about it last fall.

55	I completely expected to love this book. Then, after a few chapters, I wanted to like this book, but, ultimately, my reaction is kinda... Somewhere between "meh" and annoyance. The characters were a bit flat. They started out promising but were never lived up to their own promise. In fact they declined, steadily mostly because they mostly stayed the same and had the same inner dialogue the ENTIRE book. Even the character that seems to "change" the most is so wishy-washy in his "change" that I found myself rolling my eyes more than anything. And the magic seems mostly arbitrary and flimsy and used to the plot's convenience to be rendered wholly uninteresting and arguably annoying. The pacing is weird. Is this supposed to be action-packed or cerebral? It tried to be both, but I found myself skimming through action scenes and mentally tuning out most of the time. I'm so bummed because the premise was so interesting and intriguing. But for me, this was wholly disappointing.	{"text": "I completely expected to love this book.

57	I'm almost done with this book, and really enjoying it so far. When my friend proposed reading this I got extremely excited because this is not only the genre of books that I love, but it is different. So often, fantasy/sci-fi books explore Greek, Irish, Roman mythology, but now we have novel that focuses on West African culture and folklore. So far, the story is fast paced, the characters are multilayered, and the plot continuously develops throughout. There are so many issues that are explored that run parallel to what we are currently experiencing in society today, but doesn't distract from the story as a whole. I cannot wait to read the whole series and also see how it translates to the big screen!	{"text": "I'm almost done with this book, and really enjoying it so far.

63	This book was polarizing for me.  As a subject matter the view of mental illness from the inside out was so true to life, very powerful, and, yes, heartbreaking.  I don't know if Green has personal experience himself, or with a loved one, or if he just researched impeccably - but it's a subject that definitely needs light shed on it to promote better empathy and understanding.  So in that sense, five stars.************SPOILERS AHEAD***********However, that being said, I felt there wasn't much of a narrative.  The whole trying to get the reward for the missing criminal, who just happens to be the father of a friend from long ago 'sad camp' just made no sense to me.  The supporting characters didn't stand out all that much either (hence, why I can't even remember their names when I started the book last night and finished it this morning) and weren't terribly likable, either, nor were their motivations understandable.While I did appreciate that he didn't tie everything up with a happy little bow at the end, but was realistic in showing that, yes, mental illness is something you live with and fight (or don't) your entire life, but there are still moments of happiness, was great - but her rationale for Aza choosing to write *this* story down didn't seem to connect to her life as an adult.  She chose this particular period of her life to write about because ... I was never really clear on that.Because Green's books are usually so well-written, I can't help but wonder if he did write from personal experience, and was maybe too close to the subject to write with the clear writer's eye he usually has.	{"text": "This book was polarizing for me.

70	Here's the thing: John Green is an auto-buy for me. I know there was a bit of over-saturation when The Fault in Our Stars came out, and some people have firm (and valid) opinions on Mr. Green. With John Green, I was a little wary because of the success of The Fault in Our Stars. Tbh how could he follow up? Well, he did. While Stars was an exploration of a visible illness, Turtles All the Way Down is an exploration of a hidden disease. I've been suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder for about six years now. OCD is a hard disease to find in media. When we finally see OCD portrayed, it's often the over the top neat freak stereotype (see Monk or that chick with Glee).Not this book. From what I understand, John Green suffers from OCD, which makes a ton of sense because he writes OCD exceptionally well. Like it was almost triggering how accurate Aza's thoughts were. Before I went on medication (s/o to sertraline!) I used to have the same thought spirals. The same obsessions. The same compulsions. I cannot overstate how important this book is for people who have OCD.This book does have weaknesses though. Outside of Aza and Daisy, the characters are pretty forgettable. The mystery aspect was a lot less compelling and exciting than I had hoped.But you know what? I don't care. This book is beautiful and haunting, and you should read it despite its flaws.	{"text": "Here's the thing: John Green is an auto-buy for me.

73	I am extremely stingy with my compliments for good books, but this tale is well-deserving of the praise. Of the last dozen or so books I've read, only two others earned five complete stars by me: She Read to Us in the Late Afternoons: A Life in Novels by Kathleen Hill, and Circe by Madeline Miller.I have to confess that I have also had magical moments with marsh creatures such as herons, eagles, and mud turtles. Like the main character, Kya, I am a compulsive collector of treasures from those Great Rock Tumblers: the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean which makes this book so attractive to me. However, Delia Owens' writing is more than just about the natural world. She spins a good and very well-written tale about murder, courtroom drama, nature, poetry, and even love.Another reviewer described Owens' writing as lyrical. It is.

I laughed, I cried (a lot) and most importantly thought differently about life - mine and everyone else's.  I became the character of Kya, desperately alone and forced to try to eke out an existence on her own in the marshes.  The marshes are their own separate character, but despite the fact that I am freaked out by insects and mud and most other creepy crawlies, I could actually imagine myself enjoying the Carolina experience, hard as it was.  You will root for Kya, I did, sometimes shouting out loud- You Go Girl!!!!!  I read this book in one day and can't stop thinking about it.

Kya, six years old, watches her ma walking away from the house.  She is wearing her fake alligator skin high heels and carrying a blue train case.  Ma always turned around to wave when she reached the road, but this time she didn’t.  That was the last time Kya saw her mother.As her brothers and sisters leave one by one, Kya is left to fend for herself.  Sometimes her pa is around and sometimes he isn’t.  Kya learns to survive in the marsh.I can’t even begin to describe the life Kya leads, without giving anything away.  I don’t want there to be any spoilers because it unfolds so beautifully in the book.The story is everything, heartbreaking, heartwarming, lyrical, moving, tragic and uplifting.  I fell in love with Kya, her strength, her simple goodness.Highly recommend.I received an ARC of the book.	{"text": "I loved this book from the very first sentence to the very last sentence.The prologue begins in 1969 in the Marsh.

At first, I did wonder “Where is this going?” As usual, it led to a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. Grisham’s characters are so wonderfully created and so believable that empathy is instant. No superheroes. No blatant improbability. Just a very complex journey of the vagaries of life set in the rural south during the ‘40s.	{"text": "A masterful plot construct of “What” followed by “Why” flavored with just a sprinkle of very dark WWII history.

86	This is a disjointed, dislikable book - a soap opera with some courtroom window dressing and the Bataan Death March thrown in for no apparent reason except alleged depth of feeling. The mystery of the main character is that he won't talk - a sort of misguided Clint Eastwood Man With No Name anti-hero. Not talking can work on the screen but does tend to drag on on the page. The wife does a bad thing while her husband is slogging around in the Philippines, although it isn't clear what that is until the end. Consequences ensue. The hero kills somebody else. The generations-old family farm is lost to a shyster lawyer. Almost everybody dies. Who knew what? When did they know it? Who was wrong? In the end, who cares? I can't believe I read the whole thing.	{"text": "This is a disjointed, dislikable book - a soap opera with some courtroom window dressing and the Bataan Death March thrown in for no apparent reason except alleged depth of feeling. The mystery of the main character is that he won't talk - a sort of misguided Clint Eastwood Man With No Name anti-hero. Not talking can work on the screen but does tend to drag on on the page. The wife does a bad thing while her husband is slogging around in the Philippines, although it isn't clear what that is until the end. Consequences ensue. The hero kills somebody else.

89	Book droned on and on, did not like any of the characters Pete the killer/husband of Liza the adultress, or their children Stella and Joel.  The book took too long to tell the age old story of pure as the driven snow  white woman has sex with black man and either cries rape or blames an innocent once she's found out.  Instead of black man being lynched, husband kills alleged lover.  OMG it went on and on so much so that I skipped to the very rushed and unsatisfying ending.  I have never read John Grisham before and thought this would be a good book to get a feel for how I might enjoy his other novels.  Not gonna happen.	{"text": "Book droned on and on, did not like any of the characters Pete the killer/husband of Liza the adultress, or their children Stella and Joel.

94	I have read every John Grisham Novel and this by far the worst.  Spends a great deal of time developing characters that seem to serve no purpose, and book seems to drag on.  This is just a horrible way to treat an honored war veteran that sacrificed so much.  I wished I had never read this book.  Jonh Grisham must thoroughly hate America's war veterans and heroes to think up such a tragic story.  I will make sure I wait after he publishes his next book until the book is thoroughly vetted before purchasing it.  I bought this one pre-release - what a mistake.	{"text": "I have read every John Grisham Novel and this by far the worst.

96	I've read every one of John Grisham's books and have never been disappointed.  The Reckoning is a great read right from the get go.  Again based in Clanton County Mississippi,  he tells a great legal story mixed with heroing stories from WWII.  I appreciate that while reading a great novel you also feel like you came away learning something.Great book!	{"text": "I've read every one of John Grisham's books and have never been disappointed.

It also sniffs at American culture (Stanford: “It’s that school in California for people who can’t get into Harvard”) and wears its prejudices on its designer sleeve (“Mark’s not white, he’s Jewish — that’s basically Asian.”). Words like Chuppie, for Chinese Yuppie, may be offensive, but Mr. Kwan makes the most of them.\\n\\nAlmost no material object appears in “Crazy Rich Asians” without an announcement of its brand name. And one of the strangest things about this book is how insecure its Asian residents seem to be. Sure, shoe designers have their place in American beach reading, but Mr. Kwan works them into dialogue, not descriptions. So we get: “Parker, put down those Pierre Hardy flats or I’ll poke your eyes out with these Nicholas Kirkwood stilettos.” And: “I wouldn’t have worn my new Roger Vivier heels if I knew we were coming to a place like this.” And, from a man unhappy with his suite at the Wynn Macau: “I’m not going to dirty my Tod’s setting foot in one of those rat holes!”There’s even a poor little rich kid who, when told to wear his Gucci loafers, asks plaintively: “Which ones?”\\n\\nObviously, the romance of Nick and Rachel is only ancillary to the real (and really crazy) concerns of “Crazy Rich Asians.” All Rachel has to do is ignore the hostility of her likely future relatives, see Nick for the nice guy he truly is and admire the excess without wondering why everyone seems so pitifully materialistic and insecure. She hits the right note as soon as she gets to the airport in Singapore and remarks that it “makes JFK look like Mogadishu.” This book is neither malicious nor imaginative enough to make Rachel a gold digger or Nick a cad. So its main objective is to provide a grand tour of a humorously grandiose and showoffy world.\\n\\nMr. Kwan knows how to deliver guilty pleasures. He keeps the repartee nicely outrageous, the excess wretched and the details wickedly delectable. Who knew that an Asian menu might boast of “Giant South Sea Scallop Consommé With Washington State Ginseng Vapors and Black Mushrooms?” (“Go figure,” writes Mr. Kwan, in a footnote about why the ginseng is imported.) Who knew that an Asian socialite might include Save the Shahtoosh among her favored fashionable causes?\\n\\nAnd who knew that a Far Eastern fashion disaster might be described in such novel terms. “Never, ever wear green chiffon,” Mr. Kwan has one character warn, “unless you want to look like bok choy” that’s been violently abused.", "polarity": "neutral", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.38222986459732056, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:49:05.251731	2018-11-08 22:49:05.251731

But “Ulysses” was never this much fun. Arthur’s wanderings as he makes his way from disaster to disaster are hilariously, brilliantly harrowing. But laughter is only a part of the joy of reading this book. Greer writes sentences of arresting lyricism and beauty. His metaphors come at you like fireflies — or like the “pygmy hummingbird moths” that delight Arthur amid his latest gloom, at a golf resort he fears he has visited accidentally (in place of a vacationing Austrian doctor in red shorts and suspenders).\\n\\nDelights of language abound. On a turbulent night flight into Mexico City, “the plane convulses in the moonlight, like a man turning into a werewolf.” And in another fraught venue, “an eel of panic wriggles through him as he searches the room for exits, but life has no exits.” Even Arthur’s random observations are entertaining. Why, he bitterly wonders, do today’s young gay men insist on marrying? “Was this why we all threw stones at the police, for weddings?” And as for quaaludes, “is there any more perfect spelling than with that lazy superfluous vowel?”\\n\\nIn France, Arthur is taken to a remote area on the German border where his schedule consists of “visiting a school during the day and a library at night, with sometimes a monastery in between. … Later: He read aloud to coal miners, who listened thoughtfully. What on earth was everyone thinking? Bringing a midlist homosexual to read to French miners?”\\n\\nAt a literary festival in Italy, where he’s in the running for yet another award he’s never heard of, Arthur recalls being ambushed on stage once, excoriated as an “assimilationist” gay writer. His crime? In Arthur’s debut novel, the gay protagonist returns in the end to his (female) wife. Arthur is not a gay enough writer, it appears.\\n\\nIn Piemonte, where the Italian festival convenes, the big prize jury turns out to consist of a dozen teenagers. Again, Arthur has a bad feeling. “How has it come to this? What god has enough free time to arrange this very special humiliation, to fly a minor novelist across the world so that he can feel, in some seventh sense, the minusculitude of his own worth? Decided by high school students, in fact.”\\n\\nYet what bubbles up amid all these disasters isn’t self-pity but Arthur’s warm humanity. Pace E. M. Forster’s famous dictum, Arthur connects, especially with young people.\\n\\nThe creative writing seminar he gives in Berlin is so inventive and engaging that it could be used as a template at any college, as a model of how to get kids to fall in love with literature. He has them cut up a paragraph of “Lolita” and reassemble the text any way they want. “He gives them a page of Joyce and a bottle of Wite-Out — and Molly Bloom merely says ‘Yes.’ A game to write a persuasive opening sentence for a book they have never read … leads to a chilling start to Woolf’s ‘The Waves’: I was too far out in the ocean to hear the lifeguard shouting, ‘Shark! Shark!’” His students “learn to love language again, something that has faded like sex in a long marriage. Because of this, they learn to love their teacher.”", "polarity": "negative", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.9111393690109253, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:49:06.992131	2018-11-08 22:49:06.992131

As a father he is inclined to place himself tearfully at the center of Nic’s troubles. “People outside can vilify me,” he writes. “They can criticize me. They can blame me. Nic can. But nothing they can say or do is worse than what I do to myself every day. ‘You didn’t cause it.’ I do not believe it.”\\n\\nSo he traces Nic’s unhappiness back to his own divorce — and to his own drug use, which he once regarded as a relatively harmless recreation. Now he is mortified that he ever found Hunter S. Thompson funny and that he tried father-son marijuana smoking as a way of bonding with Nic.\\n\\nIn their overlapping accounts, which share many painful details (Nic stole from both of his trusting, younger half siblings), the trouble escalates with sad inevitability. According to “Beautiful Boy,” the father saw early signs of his son’s problems but was easily assuaged by the boy’s excuses. And there were few useful guidelines that the father could follow. (“Is your child suddenly volunteering to clean up after cocktail parties but forgetting his other chores?” asked one list of warning signs on which the father tried to rely.) By the time the police appeared to take Nic away in handcuffs, the father realized how much he had managed to ignore — and how irreversible Nic’s problems might be.\\n\\n“When I am alone,” the father writes, “I weep in a way that I have not wept since I was a young boy.” He is driven to this misery by realizing how insidiously meth addiction affects brain chemistry, how rarely it is successfully treated and how maddeningly close Nic comes to recovery, staying clean for long periods before abruptly relapsing. The reportorial side of “Beautiful Boy” explores the likelihood of a cure and comes up with little reason for hope. “There’s never going to be a drug that will make you check the peephole before you answer the door, so if it’s your dealer you won’t answer it,” one researcher tells the father.\\n\\nThe preliminary version of “Beautiful Boy” was a tough 2005 article in The New York Times Magazine, “My Addicted Son.” In expanding it into a book Mr. Sheff added some of the warm, fuzzy dailiness of family life to an otherwise stark portrait (both “Beautiful Boy” and “Tweak” describe rituals like carpooling), and, inevitably, he lost some certitude. The article ended with the hope that Nic might finally have outrun his demons; the book ends on a less resolute but perhaps more realistic note. Among Mr. Sheff’s conclusions: Nic might have benefited from being forced into rehab when his parents were still legally able to compel him to go, if only to keep him substance-free during a critical phase of adolescent development. It also ends with the demonstrably true idea that it is therapeutic both to read and to write stories like the Sheffs’.\\n\\nOn the long, crowded shelf of addiction memoirs “Beautiful Boy” is more notable for sturdiness and sense than for new insight. Even when paired with “Tweak” for a two-faceted look at the same events, it is not unprecedented. (“From Binge to Blackout: A Mother and Son Struggle With Teen Drinking,” about the drastically different perspectives of Chris Volkmann and her son Toren, remains a particularly visceral parent-child cautionary tale.) And on the subjects of parental worry, guilt and mourning, the singer Judy Collins wrote “Sanity & Grace” with exemplary wisdom. Compared with these more specialized books, “Beautiful Boy” has the advantage only when it comes to Starbucks-generated prominence.\\n\\n“Beautiful Boy” does illustrate how the most clichéd insights into addiction can also be the most accurate. Nothing here is more succinct than what Nic’s little brother says when he tries to explain addiction. “It’s like in cartoons when some character has a devil on one shoulder,” the boy says, “and an angel on the other.”", "polarity": "negative", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.453164279460907, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:49:10.475764	2018-11-08 22:49:10.475764

By the way, I strongly recommend adding the Audible Edition to your library at the reduced price of $9.47.Firstly, due to my own personal circumstances. My father, not long before he passed on eight years ago, had urged me to read and study Nicholas Sparks’s style of writing. Dad was not moved by many authors, so I noted that, but did not then do as he urged. In just the introduction to the novel, I quickly understood why Dad was so moved.Also, though, my first marriage was a story not so very different, in the essential ways, from the true story behind the novel. I, too, spent time in Africa (Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and I am convinced I shall one day return to that magical, awe-inspiring land).That employment in southern Africa became the beginning of the end of my first marriage, one of the consequences you pay while trying to deal with day-to-day challenges.Of course, had I not gone to Africa, thence, years later, to Egypt, I might never have suffered the divorce but would not have then discovered my wife of today, who is the Godsend that brought me back from the dead and failed.My point is, “Every Breath” by Nicholas Sparks opened up some old wounds BUT also healed them shut. For me, this story was epic. A life changer.BLUSH FACTOR: This love story is absent any profanities, but the love scenes, while drawing a clear, unmistakable picture, are not graphic in the sense of more risqué novels. Tantalizing? Yes, but not over-the-top graphic. Read first before deciding to read to anybody else, is the best advice I can give. Wonderful images beautifully written is another way to put it.ADVENTURE: There IS a definite sense of adventure.SOUL: Yes.CHARACTER OR VOICE: It is magical how this writer can open the story up to let it speak for itself.EDITING FOR GRAMMAR AND TYPOS: Professional editing of the highest order.THE WRITING FLOW & STYLE: I think it’s clear that this writer is moving in his narrative.POV: Third person, which works well for this story. We get to feel the emotions of the main characters so effectively due to the way point of view is used in this work.EXCERPT‘…time, she’d believed her dad to be the smartest man in the world. When she would tell him that, he’d always laugh and say that if that were true, then he would have figured out a way to earn a million dollars. Her mom was a teacher, too—second grade—and it wasn’t until Hope graduated from college and began paying her own bills that she realized how much of a financial challenge it must have been for them to raise a family, even on their combined income.Her dad had been a coach to the high school’s cross country and track teams as well. He never raised his voice, but nonetheless led his teams to numerous conference championships. Along with her sisters, Hope had participated in both sports all four years of high school, and though none of them were stars, Hope still jogged a few times a week. Her older sisters ran three or four days a week, and for the past ten years, Hope had joined her dad and her sisters at the annual Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving morning, all of them working up an appetite before sitting down at the table. Two years earlier, her dad had won his age-group bracket.But now, her dad would never run again.It had started with occasional twitches and a slight, if noticeable, fatigue. For how long, she wasn’t exactly sure, but she guessed that it had been a couple of years. In the twelve months after that, the runs in the woods became jogs, and then finally walks.Old age, his internist suggested, and it made sense. By then, her dad was in his late sixties—he’d retired four years earlier—and he had arthritis in his hips and feet. Despite a life of exercise, he took medication for slightly elevated blood pressure. Then, last January, he’d caught a cold. It was a normal, run-of-the-mill cold, but after a few weeks, her dad had still found it harder to breathe than usual.Hope had gone with him to another appointment with his internist. More tests were done. Blood work was sent to the labs. He was referred to another doctor, then another. A muscle biopsy was taken, and when the results came back, there was the suggestion of a potential neurological problem. It was at that point that Hope began to worry. More tests followed, and later, Hope sat with the rest of her family as the diagnosis of…’Sparks, Nicholas. Every Breath (Kindle Locations 465-481). Grand Central Publishing.

I have read them all and they have each made me cry, feel different emotions, and wish the books would never end. This book made my heart hurt and burst! The power of knowing that this love story is true and really out there and the pool of love can come together through anything. At the end knowing Hope's secret devastated me but in the same breath made me feel that Tru is her real love. I am in awe as to how Sparks could write their story with his own words and capture how they had to have been feeling so Well! This is a must read, I have told friends and my sister to read it with a glass of wine and tissues! Loved this book so very much! Gone are the days of amazing Nicholas Sparks;  The Notebook, The Wedding, Message in a Bottle....where has that author gone? Everytime a new novel comes out, I rush out to buy it, hoping to be blown away.. Nick Sparks disappointed me once again, boring and predictable.. He just never disappoints.  His books are like magic, with a life all their own.  You can't read one without knowing the characters intimately.  Two thumbs up...again. What a wonderful and beautiful story. The presentation was perfect and all so real. I had a hard time putting my kindle down. I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and never been disappointed.  This is so real, I felt like I was right there on the beach and in the cottage with Tru  and Hope.  Thanks for another great read!! Typically like his books but this one was just plain blah. Too predictable, too many paragraphs, pages spent on the physical intimacy of the characters. I almost didn’t finish this but figured I had spent a few hours reading and decided to push through it. I did enjoy descriptions of the scenery though. As a long-time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I loved how he changed things up, just a bit, to make this book interesting. This was a page turner! Great read!! Thiuroughly enjoyed the book as all other Nicolas Sparks books. I love Nicholas Sparks novels and this one didn’t fail. My Kleenex stash was near by. I will be recommending this book to a friend who lives in North Carolina! LIke always Nicholas Sparks is a genius when it comes to telling a story..Read it twice and am keeping it on my kindle.Great Read. It was good but not as good as he described in an interview I saw of him describing the book. Love all his books, this one is beautiful !  Will be interested to see if this is made into a film. Great story although sad in many way it was also very touching, loving and special! Had to keep reading- didn’t want to put it down! Loved the characters. They are very “real!” This story grips you from the beginning, takes you on a journey and leaves you breathless. Nicolas Sparks never disappoints in his storytelling I always enjoy books by Jonathan Sparks, and this one did not disappoint me It was different. Such a tear jerker like always but all his books are I really enjoyed it alot. Waiting for his next one it’s nicholas sparks i liked everything Another excellent Nicholas Sparks book really felt the characters pain and joy! Every Breath by Nicholas Sparks is a delightfully heartwarming and engaging romance.Thirty-six year old Hope Anderson retreats to her family’s beach cottage after another fight with her long time boyfriend Josh. The two have been dating off and on for the past six years and she is beginning to think he will never be ready to fully commit to her. Following their latest argument, their relationship is off yet again and Josh’s decision to go to Las Vegas with his friends instead of attending a wedding in North Carolina with Hope is quite disheartening. Unable to give up on her dreams of motherhood and marriage, Hope is hoping to work things out with Josh, but will meeting Tru Walls change the direction of her life?Tru has flown to the NC coast from Zimbabwe to meet his biological father for the first time. Tru is forty-two year divorced father and a wild life safari guide who spends the most of his time in the African bush.  Despite losing his mother in a tragic fire and a troubled relationship with his step-father and half-siblings, Tru is comfortable in his skin and content with his life. The only reason he agrees to meet his father is to hopefully glean information about his mother.  With his father’s arrival delayed, Tru  is enjoying his time on the beach when he  begins spending time with Hope.Hope and Tru do not have much time together but their relationship is intense and emotional. Having confided in one another, their burgeoning friendship quickly turns romantic although neither of them envision a future together. Despite the strength of her feelings for Tru, Hope cannot give up on her six year relationship with Josh. Tru’s life is in Zimbabwe with his son but he cannot let Hope leave without confessing his love to her. Will Hope and Tru find a way to be together?Every Breath is a wonderfully romantic novel that is fast-paced and compelling. Tru and Hope are terrific characters who are immensely appealing and completely lovable. The beach setting is quite picturesque and easy to visualize. The descriptions of Tru’s life in Zimbabwe bring the country vibrantly to life.  Nicholas Sparks opens and closes the story with very intriguing entries that are unique and clever. The novel’s deeply affecting conclusion is poignant yet uplifting. I absolutely loved and highly recommend this heartfelt and endearing novel to fans of the genre.I received a complimentary copy for review. This was the very first audiobook that i listened to all the way through. At first I wasn’t sure how I would like it since the voice of Tru was so deep and the voice for Hope seemed a little on the valley girl side. But as I listened more they proved to be not at all what I thought but very fitting for the characters in this story. I believe I was just so used to hearing the voices in my head when I read as opposed to actually hearing other people’s impersonations of the character they have heard. Very well done by Vanessa Johansson and Sean Cameron Michael the narrators.I did not read the back of the book before diving in. I sadly have only read one other Nicholas Sparks book so far and have been wanting to read more for awhile now. What better way to dive in than with a NEW book! So without even knowing what this story was going to be about besides the usual location of North Carolina and being a love story I began to listen to the makings of another wonderful Nicholas Sparks creation.Tru Walls was a character that I grew to love very quickly. He was a very passionate man who showed that in all that he was, his choice of career, his love for his son, and the values he set forth in life. He was a calm and peaceful man who even as a reader was able to sense that calm and peaceful felling from the descriptions that Nicolas portrayed in his writing. He set off on his 1st trip to America to meet the father he had never known or never really cared to know. But having lost his mother at such a young age his curiosity about who she was drew him to meet his father when he received the letter and airplane ticket. Never did he think the trip to America would result in some of the best days of his life and the worst.Hope Anderson was stuck in a relationship that never seemed to be going the way she wanted. She was still not married and had no children. She dreamed of being a mother more than anything else. As her long term relationship took another “break” she decided to head to her family cottage on the beach to think about her life and where it was going. She never expected to fall in love with a stranger and then have to make the hardest decision in her life.Tru and Hope together were magical, a dream so many wish they encountered themselves.  The drew strength and comfort from each other.  True soulmates torn apart by dreams and family obligations.  Would these souls be kindred spirits in the end?I do not want to give away too much about this story but I will tell you that you may need a tissue or two to get through this book. Be prepared to be captivated by the workings of the master of love Nicholas Sparks. He truly has a way with words…making you swoon and breaking your heart all within 320 some odd pages.Congratulations Nicholas Sparks on another exceptional story! I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, and was excited when I got an early copy of his new release.  I really enjoyed the introduction to this story from the author and where he got his inspiration for this book.  I think I enjoyed this even more knowing a little about the back story and that it really based off true events.I do feel it was different than his other work.  It was not my favorite book I have read from the author, but it was still great.  I loved the story between True and Hope.  I liked learning about how they met, their life when they were apart, and especially when they come back together.  I think the mailbox at Kindred Spirit sounds amazing and a place I would love to visit one day.This was emotional at times when talking about the parents of both True and Hope.  I was waiting for the signature heart-wrenching moment that is in all of Nicholas Sparks books.  Although this was very sad at times, it just never hit that level that most of his books have in the past.  I know some people hate those, but I personally love that about his stories.  I was a little let down when it came to that.  Do not get me wrong, there were still several times your heart will break as you learn more about their story.Overall, this was an amazing and crazy love story.  I would never have guessed that this was a real story without knowing it from the beginning.  I really enjoyed it. This book starts out with a dated letter from the author, stating that it is a true story that has been retold with things changed for privacy. Then you get to the end of the book, and he’s like, nope! This was just a work of fiction..... I really don’t know why he felt the need to write the book this way. Just write it like all your other books. It really made me angry.  With that being said, there was a big editing mistake, which I have attached as a photo- it was Hope, not Claire, getting her nails done for the wedding. Claire was the hair stylist.... I was really in to the book until near the end. (Spoilers!) I thought Hope was super selfish for choosing to stay with Josh who was obviously not marriage material to begin with- what women stays with a guy for 6 years who continually cheats on her? Just so she can have kids? I don’t get it. Then, I thought there was way too much story after she and Tru reunited. The book should’ve just ended- she turns around at the mailbox, sees him, they embrace, story over. Did she really need to be diagnosed with ALS?  I think Nicholas has this huge problem of needing to kill a character or have something otherwise horrible happen to them. That doesn’t equate to a good story. I felt like this book was being written in a way to be turned in to a movie later. That’s not why you should write a book. I read the book in one day, and I waited a whole day to write this review. My feelings haven’t changed. I guess he will never make a book as good as the notebook again. Why do I keep buying them? Too predictable. EVERY BREATH by Nicholas Sparks is a stand alone love story focusing on forty-two year divorced father and safari tour guide Tru Walls, and thirty-six year old, trauma nurse Hope Anderson.Told from third person perspectives EVERY BREATH takes the reader back to the year 1990 focusing on one week in the life of forty-two year divorced father and African safari tour guide Tru Walls, and thirty-six year old, trauma nurse Hope Anderson.  Tru Walls, a safari guide born and raised in Zimbabwe, has come to America in search of answers about his mother and her past. Meeting trauma nurse Hope Anderson stirred something deep within our story line hero, something he would always remember including the love for a woman who was torn between head and heart. Fast forward to 2014 wherein Tru will reconnect with the woman he has never stopped loving only to discover she has never stopped loving him in return.Divided into two parts (1990 and 2014) EVERY BREATH is a story based in reality brought about by a journal and letters found in an isolated mailbox called Kindred Spirit near the dunes of Sunset Beach, North Carolina.  The mailbox, belonging to everyone and no one, is a treasury of love letters from the lost; stories of then and now; a place for dreams and happily ever afters to live on when someone dies.  Nicholas Sparks uses artistic license to spin a love story spanning decades focusing on two people whose lives went in opposite directions eventually meeting to form their own happily ever after. Reflective in nature EVERY BREATH reconnects with the past revealing twenty-plus years of pain, heartache, failures and success eventually meandering back to Sunset Beach where it all began.An imaginative, heart breaking and emotional story line EVERY BREATH looks at love and loss; family and duty; reconnection, dreams, and hope. Uniquely Nicholas Sparks EVERY BREATH is a wonderful love story that will captivate and enchant as you reflect upon your own life of what ifs and whys. Every city and town should have their own ‘Kindred Spirit’ in the hopes of living on in the minds of others. I listened to the audio book. As always, I loved Sparks' attention to detail, learning a bit about Africa, and the characters were great. Kinda pissed at Hope for her decision. I had to suspend my disbelief that they fell in love so quickly (and so deeply) as they did in just a couple days, but that's the nature of fiction so it's not really a complaint.  (P.S.: the narrators were great!) This is a  fantastic book. I don't know how Sparks comes up with these amazing stories. I've  read all his books and there all great, but I have several favorites. This book is my 2nd  favorite.  My 1st favorite is 3 weeks with my brother which is nonfiction. I loved this book the whole way through, the ending was the best and actually made the book extra special. I believed. You see what you think.. Could not get over the narrator terrible. Story was taking too long to get to the point of the book. Gave up on chapter 5 This book was great from start to finish! Unexpected twists, lots of love and a few tears too! Every Breath seriously needs an editor. There is so much “tell” and not enough “show” that the story moves at a glacial pace, compounded by an overreliance on long inner monologues. I grabbed Every Breath on a whim because my sister-in-law raves about The Notebook. I had not read any books by Nicholas Sparks nor seen any movie made from his books, but I like a good romance. Every Breath came up as #1 on Amazon under Clean & Wholesome Romance. I was a bit surprised when I hit a sex scene at 47%. Now, normally this wouldn’t bother me, but here I am about halfway through the book and almost nothing has happened. At all.To be fair, there was a little action. A man drove to the airport and thought of the danger it would be if it were night. He flew to the US. A lady visited her parents’ cottage by the shore. They met on the beach. They met at a restaurant. They talked a bit. They inhabited slow scenes with lots of inner monologues, lots of descriptions, and virtually no action. Finally something happened! These two people who have known each other about two days, I think (sorry, lost track with all the inner ramblings), are now madly in love and jumping into bed. I think he ate some olives in there somewhere. Did they eat their dinner that she was chopping veggies for? I was so bored I can't remember.The woman is trying to assess her six-year relationship with the man she loves because he’s so perfect; she intends to marry him and have the children she’s been yearning for as soon as they get over this rough spot in their relationship. The man she’s just met has no intentions of ever marrying, is sterile and can’t have kids, is a lone wolf who loves his solitary life with the exception of missing his son (begotten before he was sterile, sorry for any confusion there). And suddenly these two acquaintances know that they are deeply in love with each other. They knew upon seeing each other (she’s beautiful; his butt looks nice in tight jeans) how incredible their connection is. They share a few stories and a dinner and are now presumably rocking toward happily ever after. Or at least, the bedroom.Something must happen in the last half of the book, but I don’t really care. I’m so bored and irritated with the overkill on inner monologues, the plodding pace, plus the hackneyed instalove cliché, that my eye rolls gave me a headache. (Confession: it was the frustration with the story that gave me the headache, not the eye rolling.) Every Breath is a DNF for me.ETA: Another reviewer said they read the entire book and in the author note at the end, Nicholas Sparks admits the entire premise of the book is a lie. The book is NOT based on a true story. That's despicable, imo. Before buying the book, I read the intro as part of the sample, I double-checked that that the author had signed and dated the intro, just as authors do for true introductory notes, and I had checked that the Kindred Spirit mailbox is real (it is). I did all that because I wanted to make sure it was based on a true story before I read it. That premise drew me to the book. To find out the whole intro is a dramatic fabrication, a literary device, makes me glad that I didn't finish the book and find that at the end. Nicholas Sparks deliberately played and manipulated us readers with that intro. Not cool. The first half of the book was promising, but unfortunately it then became a boring '\\"tell\\" with not enough \\"show.\\"  Conversation during their first restaurant dinner was yawn- worthy with predictable questions and answers.  Nicholas Sparks writing sex scenes?  Made me cringe. Maybe he was trying to breathe some life into this dull narrative. My wife has read every N Sparks books. Her first day and she said she \\"had to slow her reading so it will last\\". I think she likes it. Since today was day one, I haven't got her feed back on the book as a whole. But I do know she had a hard time putting it down. She could have read it one day, but she chooses to take her time with it. I have loved all the books by Nicholas Sparks and although this one has some good pages it was a  bit of a disappointment. It jumped around and there were big gaps of time ignored. Hope his next one is better. Another Sparks treasure.  Somewhat different, but nevertheless heartwarming and a joy to read - a true lesson to be learned. The beginning didn't grab me as quickly as Sparks usually does, but once the story actually started, I was hooked! Classic Nicholas Sparks with great characters and love story This story grips the reader fairly quickly. The tale is a poignant one that readers of the old Nicholas Sparks will enjoy! Took me two days to get through it, couldn't stop! When I read in the prologue that this novel was based on a true story, I wondered if it would live up to my expectations. I need not have worried; Nicholas Sparks worked his magic to spin a tale that seemed to flow effortlessly onto the page.A love story woven together with magic, destiny, hearthache, and hope that will likely keep you enchanted for hours at a time. Incredible read, takes you thru every emotion from total joy to total sorrow.  I finished it in two days, hard to put it down.  I haven’t cried from a book since Love Story, 40 years ago. Loved the story from the beginning to end.  By far one of the best books I’ve read by Nicholas Sparks!!! Nicholas Sparks does it again! Nicholas Sparks does it again! Engrosses the reader into his characters.  I have read every single book he’s written. This one is just so special. He has got to be the best story teller in this century. Keep on writing, you will forever have a reader. I highly recommend this book. Get cozy and immerse yourself in his written words! Can’t wait to read this book I loved it. I think this is the best book he has written yet; and that's saying a lot because most of his books are incredible! Loved it from the very first word to the last. Loved the way he introduces us to the characters/setting and then wraps the story. You've got to read this book. Started slowly but the story is definitely worthy of reading. I haven’t finished it yet but expect to want to read it again like I do all of Nicholas Sparks ‘  books! Nicholas Sparks has given us another great romance set at the beach in North Carolina. This was a light book with themes of love and sadness and hope for the future. Sometimes love arrives at just the right time in people's lives but sometimes its at a time in their lives that it just won't work and people get hurt. This is the case with Hope and Tru. When they met on Sunset Beach, she was taking a break from her long time boyfriend and wondering if they had a future together. He was on a visit from Zimbabwe where he was a safari guide, on his first trip to America to meet his father for the first time. He had a child in Zimbabwe who meant the world to him. When Hope and Tru meet, sparks fly and they fall in love over a matter of days. When they have to make a choice between personal happiness and family responsibilities, it's devastating for both of them. Will they ever meet again and if they do, will their love survive over the year?This was an enduring, heart-warming novel that will have you believe that love can conquer all and last a life time. can't wait for the movie  to come out Sparks is an amazing writer.  I could not put this one down. More like his old originals! I love Nicholas Sparks. I have read everyone of his books.  I gave this a four-star,  because to me it was a slow read at first, but then it got a lot better to where every spare moment I tried to read a page or two.  It is a very touching story,  with a very good ending . Excellent read.

At two in the morning I woke to lights on.  She hadn't stopped reading!  We talked this morning about it and her favorite word to use was \\"WOW.\\"  She is in love with the heroine (a young girl) who fights for her beliefs without fear.  When I told my kiddo that she might want to think about how this story is somewhat of an analogy to race relations in America her eyes went wide (and I got another \\"wow).  \\"Mom, that's true! Ok - now I have to go finish it this morning.....\\"Thank you Tomi for bringing a story to my family that has so many levels:  strong female characters, a worthy struggle, and a clear method of analogy to discuss the difficulties of race in our country. I have been anticipating Children of Blood and Bone since I heard about it last fall. I was a little worried that I would be disappointed because I was looking forward to it so much. I finished it this morning and if anything, I was too reserved in my excitement. It is exactly the kind of sweeping fantasy that I love, and it has so many layers that give it much deeper meaning. I hate spoilers, so all I will say about the plot is that I love Tomi Adeyemi’s choices and where she took each of the characters. Unless you’ve seen or read interviews with the author, it’s important read the author’s note at the end of the book, which gives the story a modern context. That context makes the story even more meaningful. I really enjoyed her writing, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book. Even when things seemed to be going well, I felt like I couldn’t let my guard down, which is surely intentional.I love that women were central to the story, and I appreciate the way that the relationship between Zélie and Amari developed. It is an empowering story on many levels. I don't think I've ever read a fantasy or science fiction book where ALL the characters were Black, and I tried to make sure I pictured the characters as the author intended, occasionally catching myself and having to re-draw a character in my head.As someone who pretty much never re-reads a book, I will be reading this one again. And of course, I am already anticipating the sequel. I can’t wait to find out what happens and I'm hoping we get to meet more of the different clans. I also really hope they get the movie right, because it could be amazing on the big screen.I've read some pretty good books in the past year, but this is without a doubt my favorite. Such a good book! I'm an adult. Like, grown. I am also a fan of Harry Potter and Tahereh Mafi, which I read as a child through college, and last year, respectively. To be fair, I buy books 'for my niece' and read them quickly before I give them to her as gifts so we can discuss them together - an activity I enjoy immensely. As a black woman who loves the fantasy genre, Adeyemi is my new hero for creating a world that draws its richness and depth from West Africa. We have a class of oppressed people who have gifts that the oppressors are afraid of - a theme so relevant to life today as a Diasporan in America. I remember reading an article that spoke of implicit bias and the belief that some people have that black people are magical and have almost super-human strength, and that those were seen as reasons to justify fear of black bodies. Adeyemi throws that on its head, and I can't wait to read (and see!) what happens next in Orïsha, and I can't wait to hear what my niece thinks of the book! #blackgirlmagic Let me list the things I loved about this book:The characters are divine.I LOVED the different perspectives. Every one of them. Zélie is the perfect protagonist because she’s vibrant and projects real vulnerabilities and a ferocity that’s easy to identify with and root for. Amari is a gem and a sweetheart and her character’s growth was my favorite of the three leads. And Inan, he was the most compelling character for me since he’s so tragic, with his conflicted beliefs and destructive actions. Aside from the leads, there are many secondary characters that pulled me into the story. Zélie’s brother is a hero and a true prince and I would’ve loved a few scenes from his perspective. The king is a great villain, and I enjoyed reading about his backstory. Actually, I loved reading about all the characters’ backstories and how their stories were connected to Orïsha. My only complaint, and it’s a tiny one, is that there were a few characters who...left too soon and I would’ve loved more scenes with them. But hell, it’s the first book in a YA series and already 525 pages so everyone couldn’t have gotten a POV, right?The story gripped me and the pace thrilled me.I found CBB to be a quickly paced read bursting with action (and violence!) and magic. The chapters are relatively short, and each and every scene grabbed my attention. Seriously, every one. There isn’t excessive world building which I loved since I think it helped the story move along at a pace that matches the urgency of the stakes the characters face. I had to force myself to slow down and savor it, and I still felt like it ended too soon when it was over. Not to say there aren’t a few quiet moments, because there are, and I loved those moments since they allowed me to get to know the characters and for the characters to know each other. (Loved those dream sequences!)The message and themes are profound and universal.This is a story about fear and intolerance and how that leads to violence and oppression. Orïsha is a fractured nation with a horrific past, and a hopeless future for too many who live without freedom. This is a fantasy land, but it’s clear it draws from real life atrocities that occur daily in the world around us and that allows this novel to have weight. The stakes are high, and the trauma is real and personal. It’s also a story about faith and believing in a power greater than yourself. It’s about believing in people and how we’re all connected as one. Yes, it tackles some tough and distressing issues, and the characters experience so much pain and strife, but there is hope and there is love and moments of joy and humor.There’s also romance.Though it’s not the central theme of the novel, and when you look at the novel it doesn’t take up much space, there is romance for a few characters. One romantic plot is intense and fast, and the other is more slow burning, but they both added depth to the story and softer layers to the world filled with terror and rage. It also provided sweetness and relief from the urgency to succeed in their quest.The more intense romance could potentially be unsatisfying for a few readers since its intensity builds quickly over a short span of time. For me, I loved it for the way it unfolded and how—I’m trying not to give too much away—the author uses the magic to allow these characters to connect on a deeper level than would be possible in a different setting.The other romantic plot line didn’t delve as deeply into the characters’ feelings, but there’s much room to grow for that love story and I’m so excited to see how it plays out.The possibilities...They’re endless, and I’m sure they’ll be torturous. This is the first in a series, so it’s not a spoiler to say it ends with a cliffhanger, and I’m so happy to say it ends on one of the better cliffhangers that I’ve read. The journey that these characters travel throughout the story does climax in the final chapter, but it’s the type of bang that is really a beginning. I have re-read the epilogue a few times and my mind is dizzy with different possibilities. I’m going down so many different roads, and my excitement continues to build because I just know the next book is going to be amazing. It must be—this world is amazing. I want more. I WANT MORE.CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE is all that I hoped it would be. It’s all that I hoped it would be. How often does that happen? It’s a wonderful feeling. I completely expected to love this book. Then, after a few chapters, I wanted to like this book, but, ultimately, my reaction is kinda... Somewhere between \\"meh\\" and annoyance. The characters were a bit flat. They started out promising but were never lived up to their own promise. In fact they declined, steadily mostly because they mostly stayed the same and had the same inner dialogue the ENTIRE book. Even the character that seems to \\"change\\" the most is so wishy-washy in his \\"change\\" that I found myself rolling my eyes more than anything. And the magic seems mostly arbitrary and flimsy and used to the plot's convenience to be rendered wholly uninteresting and arguably annoying. The pacing is weird. Is this supposed to be action-packed or cerebral? It tried to be both, but I found myself skimming through action scenes and mentally tuning out most of the time. I'm so bummed because the premise was so interesting and intriguing. But for me, this was wholly disappointing. As I recover from binge-reading this book, a few words circle around in my brain: this book was amazing. Not only does it have magic, complex characters, and a cause many of us can relate to, but it also has amazing world-building and a plot that will pull at your heartstrings.A quick summary of the world: Orïsha is a country where magic used to roam. The kosidán, those without magic, were afraid of the maji’s power, and as such waged war against them. But as long as the maji had power, they were able to keep the kosidán at bay. Until Saran, a zealous king, figured out a way to break off the connection the maji had with the gods. Then Saran ordered all of the maji killed—sparing the ibawi (those who cannot yet do magic but will be able to once they turn 13) since they were not trained in the ways of magic.This is where the story comes in. It’s been eleven years since magic disappeared from the world, and Zélie is treated like a maggot—a derogatory term for Divîners, those who were born with white hair and the ability to do magic (although magic no longer exists). She gets thrown into a quest to bring magic back, but is almost thwarted at every turn by the king’s forces.Zélie is everything I want in a protagonist. She’s stubborn, smart, empathetic, and has got flaws. Adeyemi’s writing makes her such a relatable character, with a backstory that drives her to succeed in her mission. I love getting to know her and I love that she’s not perfect. There are a lot of books out there where the hero is always right and never really doubts themselves and Zélie isn’t like that. She reads like a human being, with real inner and outer struggles. She’s lost so much and that makes her even more compassionate towards others. She doesn’t hesitate to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves and it’s that strength and stubbornness that gets her into trouble, but also makes her a kind soul. She’s also super quick with her comebacks and a little snarky, which adds some lightness that is needed.Zélie isn’t the only one with a backstory. The main antagonist, Inan, isn’t pure evil. Because of the rotating POVs, we get to see his struggle—his inner monologue—and we get to, while not relate, at least understand why he’s making the choices he’s making. I am not one for the “pure evil” villain, and Inan is certainly not one of those. While I don’t always agree with Inan’s choices, I can’t truly hate him because I see what drives him. His intentions are mostly pure, and he does care about his people. He just tries to protect them in a way that ends up hurting most of his people. (His dad, Saran, doesn’t seem to care for the Divîners at all and doesn’t hesitate to hurt anyone with magical abilities).I absolutely loved seeing Amari grow. While I didn’t really feel a connection with her in the beginning, the way she grew into herself made me smile and really proud. I loved it when she chose to stay and fight for what she believed right, even if it meant going against her family. Towards the end we got to see more of her and a little bit more of how she stepped up into her role as an active fighter against injustice. While in the beginning a lot of her choices were made in the heat of the moment, we see her own up to her choices and choose to stay in the fight to get magic back. There’s a scene towards the end where she helps Zélie through a traumatic event, and it makes me really happy that she took her experiences and turned them into a way she could help Zélie heal. Amari and Zélie’s friendship is my favorite relationship in this book because while they didn’t start out as friends, they bonded because of their experiences and were able to truly understand each other.Zélie’s brother, Tzain, is the only one of the four main characters that doesn’t have a POV in the story. But even so, I really enjoyed reading scenes with him in it. He’s compassionate and really cares for his sister, and will do anything to protect her, even if it means getting the aftermath of his sister’s choices. His role is the protector in the book, and it’s hard for him to do what he wants because he’s driven by his need to take care of his family. His relationship with Zélie is most definitely a sibling relationship, because even though they fight, they are still willing to die for each other.(And I can’t forget Nailah—Zélie’s Lionaire! I loved that animal!)Adeyemi’s world-building was off-the-charts amazing. Her world’s mythology—influenced by Yoruba culture—was beautiful and I truly loved the stories of how magic came to be. Her writing sucked me in and had me flipping the pages to find out what happened. The plot is so smooth and a lot of people aren’t merely good or evil. Most of the time you can see why certain characters acted the way they did, and it’s that writing that made me love the book.Adeyemi’s book is absolutely beautiful and I recommend it to people who love good world-building, magic, coming-of-age stories, and complex characters. This book not only has amazing writing, but it’s got fully fleshed-out characters that you can relate to. I'm almost done with this book, and really enjoying it so far. When my friend proposed reading this I got extremely excited because this is not only the genre of books that I love, but it is different. So often, fantasy/sci-fi books explore Greek, Irish, Roman mythology, but now we have novel that focuses on West African culture and folklore. So far, the story is fast paced, the characters are multilayered, and the plot continuously develops throughout. There are so many issues that are explored that run parallel to what we are currently experiencing in society today, but doesn't distract from the story as a whole. I cannot wait to read the whole series and also see how it translates to the big screen! This book is a West African fantasy that takes place in the land of Orïsha.  At first I wasn't sure how I would like this book since it got so much hype but it was certainly worth all the hype it did get. Despite how long it was the writing was amazing.  To me it felt like the pace of the story was fast paced. This stories has three different point of views.  I enjoyed the characters in this story, Zelie is such a fierce warrior. I also loved that Zelie and Amari who are very tough women.They were two people who should have been enemies. Amari is the daughter of the King and thankfully, she  is nothing like her tyrant father.  They live in a land that use to thrive on magic.  But now the king of Orïsha wants to make sure magic is kept dead. They constantly keep the reminder that the Diviners are lesser so that they won't remember how powerful they were. This is one book you defiantly want to pick up and read. *** 5+++ Stars!!! ***THIS BOOKTHIS! BOOOOK!!!Absolutely magnificent. This book was pure magicTomi Adeyemi has already achieved greatness and she's on her way to so much more!! She has been compared to extremely accomplished authors and this book was picked up to be adapted into film BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED!!! Oh, and did I mention she also signed a 7-figure book deal all at the age of 23?Children of Blood and Bone tells the story of a young girl named Zélie who goes on a quest to bring magic back to Orïsha with the help of her brother, Tzain, and the princess of Orïsha, Amari. The king of Orïsha has a strong hatred for maji and once ordered everyone who possessed magic to be killed, including Zélie's mother. Add in the fact that the king sends his son and future king, Inan to go after the three and the task of bringing magic back seems almost impossible.Every paragraph was rich, filled with soul and devastatingly beautiful. I had to stop reading so many times just to express my love for Ms. Adeyemi's writing!!! YA Fantasy needs more exciting books like this! I can't wait to read more from this author. When I was a teenager, Harry Potter was the biggest and most popular book and movie series. I believe the Legacy of Orïsha series will be just as popular among today's teens. This series is going to be the next cultural phenomenon and I can't wait to see Tomi Adeyemi achieve more and more much deserved success.Important topics were also brought up in this novel such as colorism and police brutality among the Black community.\\"You're people, your guards- they're nothing more than killers, rapists, and thieves. The only difference between them and criminals is the uniforms they wear\\"My heart ached for Zélie and her people. Knowing that how the maji were treated is all too real for Black people made it that much more painful. The maji were hated, oppressed, sometimes enslaved, and even killed because of the prejudice against them. This book is so important and I can't imagine what Adeyemi felt as she wrote it.The characters and their development was outstanding. One of my favorite aspects of this novel was the friendship between Zélie and Amari.\\"I rest my forehead against hers, and we sit in a comfortable silence, translating our love though touch. The Princess and the Warrior, I decide in my head. When they tell the story of tomorrow, that is what they shall call it.\\"Two young girls, who the world believes should hate each other, threw prejudice aside and a heartwarming friendship blossomed. Seeing these two girls share something so pure amidst so much hatred and danger filled me with hope and love.\\"I want you to be happy, Zél. More than you realize.\\"This is a book that everyone needs to read regardless of whether or not you enjoy this genre, or even enjoy reading at all. I seriously cannot get over how much I loved this book and these characters!!By the end of this novel, I had tears in my eyes and I kept praying, just one more chapter! Ms. Adeyemi has created a masterpiece and I will be (very) impatiently waiting for book two in the series, Children of Virtue and Vengeance! WOW! Simply put, this book was just… DOPE! I was completely enthralled from the first page. I absolutely love the cover as it really helps you envision Zélie on her journey.Zélie’s family and many other families were ripped apart the day that King Saran decided that magic was evil and all maji should be slaughtered. That was the day that magic died and her mother was among the many victims to be slaughtered. From that day going forward, her people were treated terribly, some were enslaved and were called “maggots” in the land of Orïsha. She soon found out that it was her destiny to bring back magic to her people. With the help of her brother, Tzain, as well as Amari, the Princess who wants to right her fathers wrongs.  All the while, being followed by Prince Inan, brother of Amari. Soon enough, he discovers that he actually has a secret of his own that he doesn’t ever want to be revealed. Loyal to his father/King he is committed to his mission, he was tasked by his father to bring back Amari as well as Zélie while his soldiers destroy the villages. Eventually their paths will cross again – Will Inan see things the way that his sister, Amari, does? Will Zélie be able to bring back magic and end the oppression of which her people have endured?Zélie is such an inspiring and strong main character, her strength and determination gives her the sheer will that she needs to continue on her journey even when she isn’t completely sure of her ability to restore magic. The supporting characters, Amari, Tzain, Inan and even her leoponaire, Nailah, were so crucial to the story. You also get the POV of 3 characters, Zélie, Amari and Inan. Inan is so conflicted and unsure of his own moral standing with magic and he constantly struggles to always go by the words that his father has always drilled into his head, “Duty over Self”. I sympathized with Zélie over the betrayal that she encounters towards the end of the book and you’re left hoping for some closure between her and Inan (hopefully we’ll see this in the next book!)I have good and sad news…. first the sad news… the 2nd book in this series, “Children of Virtue and Vengeance (Legacy of Orisha)“, is not set to be released until 3/5/2019 (UGH SUCH A LONG WAIT! 😦 😦 ). But the good news…. is that Tomi Adeyemi is currently in talks with the team at Fox 2000 and Temple Hill Productions to start a possible production of getting this book on screen! While there are no concrete dates as of yet, I can’t wait to see this book come to life!All in all, I absolutely loved the new heights that this book has taken me to. I look forward to more of Tomi Adeyemi’s work in the future!

I got it at school at 11:40 am on release day and finished it at 6:25 pm and it BROKE. MY. HEART.It’s the most powerful and open book about mental illness that I have read, and it’s required reading for everyone, but especially those who don’t understand the intensity of OCD and extreme anxiety. It is unlike any of his other work, but it’s still funny and it’s still so so sad, but it’s also Green’s OWN struggle.Go read his interview with NYT and try to tell me you didn’t want to cry.And if I see even ONE “but it’s not like TFIOS” whiny review…….don’t get me started.Read this book. Work through the discomfort. Honor his pain. I just finished reading it. And I am sitting here crying. I hated it. And I absolutely loved it.Now that you are utterly confused, read on if any one you love struggles with mental illness.I hated this book for a lot of reasons. I hated it because the characters in it bug the crap out of me. Worse than some of the more annoying people in my real life. I hated it because there are things stylistically I wanted from this author, because he is one of my favorite authors, and those things, stylistically, were not really there.I hate it because my greatest fear in life is of spiraling into uncontrollable mental illness, and the book puts you inside the head of someone who has a spiraling mental illness, and it does so with just an eerie amount of accuracy, and I don't want to be inside that spiral. It is too scary inside that spiral.And I hate this book most of all because some of the people I love most in life, people who truly own parts of my soul, live inside that spiral far too often, and it hurts deep down to be reminded of that. I don't like to read books that make me hurt. I usually avoid them at all costs. If I start one, and discover it is that kind of book, I don't often finish it.But this book is by John Green, with whom I have a relationship that is hard to explain. Because so much of the history minutiae I have memorized is from Crash Course videos, he is the voice inside my head when I think of history. He is much smarter than me, which I admire, and a phenomenal writer, which I envy. So I had to finish the book.I absolutely love this book because revealing your inner demons in such vivid reality is incredibly brave, and that makes him a hero in my eyes. John Green suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (which is not ever named in the book, but it is painted in horrifically detailed words throughout). People don't talk about mental illness enough, but here he is revealing his inmost self. And yes, it is him. He has been doing interviews about it and whatnot. The doctor the protagonist sees in the book is even similarly named to his own doctor, whom he thanks in the acknowledgements. John Green has a credibility with teenagers that is pretty hard to establish, and as a result, millions of teenagers are going to read this book. That might not seem a small thing, but it might mean that perhaps the world will understand mental illness just a little bit better. For that, John Green is my hero. Read at your own risk.And I am still crying. This book was polarizing for me.  As a subject matter the view of mental illness from the inside out was so true to life, very powerful, and, yes, heartbreaking.  I don't know if Green has personal experience himself, or with a loved one, or if he just researched impeccably - but it's a subject that definitely needs light shed on it to promote better empathy and understanding.  So in that sense, five stars.************SPOILERS AHEAD***********However, that being said, I felt there wasn't much of a narrative.  The whole trying to get the reward for the missing criminal, who just happens to be the father of a friend from long ago 'sad camp' just made no sense to me.  The supporting characters didn't stand out all that much either (hence, why I can't even remember their names when I started the book last night and finished it this morning) and weren't terribly likable, either, nor were their motivations understandable.While I did appreciate that he didn't tie everything up with a happy little bow at the end, but was realistic in showing that, yes, mental illness is something you live with and fight (or don't) your entire life, but there are still moments of happiness, was great - but her rationale for Aza choosing to write *this* story down didn't seem to connect to her life as an adult.  She chose this particular period of her life to write about because ... I was never really clear on that.Because Green's books are usually so well-written, I can't help but wonder if he did write from personal experience, and was maybe too close to the subject to write with the clear writer's eye he usually has. There are books that you read and you know you will hear them in your head later, for days, weeks, years. This is that kind of book. Poetry in prose.While reading it I could hear John's voice speaking through the page.. Ever since Turtles All the Way Down was announced, I’ve been looking forward to it. I can honestly say it did not disappoint and was totally worth the wait. My best friend shares some characteristics with Aza, particularly the health-related thought spirals. Because of this, I really identified with Daisy. In fact, I highlighted this quote and shared it with my best friend:“…What I want to say to you, Holmesy, is that yes, you are exhausting, and yes, being your friend is work. But you are also the most fascinating person I have ever known, and you are not like mustard. You are like pizza, which is the highest compliment I can pay a person.”That is exactly how I feel. It is work to have a best friend dealing with mental illness, but it’s totally and completely worth it.Unlike some of John Green’s other books, Turtles All the Way Down wasn’t overly heart in a blendery (the end is kind of heartbreaking, but not on a TFiOS or Looking for Alaska level). It was, however, raw and honest. I don’t think an author without OCD himself could’ve written those thought spirals and Aza’s actions to be so real. I highly recommend this book to YA fans and pretty much everyone else. It’s really an excellent book. \\"I was beginning to learn that your life is a story told about you, not one that you tell.\\"It was like reading an autobiography (that someone else wrote for me).Change the fear of bacteria to the fear of losing loved ones, and that is my life.Turtles all the way down.I don't think there is any other novel I have read in recent past that struct such perfect cord.Favorite Lines:* Love is not a tragedy or a failure, but a gift.* You remember your first love because they show you, prove to you, that you can love and be loved, that nothing in this world is deserved except for love, that love is both how you become a person, and why.* I would never slay the dragon, because the dragon was also me.* To be alive is to be missing.* The problem with happy endings is that they're either not really happy, or not really ending.* You're the storyteller and the story told.* The world is also the stories we tell about it.* I remember what I've imagined and imagine what I remember.* Thoughts are just a different kind of bacteria, colonizing you.* I knew how disgusting I was. I knew. I knew now for sure. I wasn't possessed by a demon. I was the demon.* What I love about science is that as you learn, you don't really get answers. You just get better questions.* I couldn't make myself happy, but I could make people around me miserable.* One of the defining features of parent is that they don't get paid to love you.* Being vulnerable is asking to get used.* Maybe I am just a lie that I am whispering to myself.* Your now is not your forever.* In some ways, pain is the opposite of language.* Illness is a story told in past tense.* I don't mind worries. Worrying is the correct worldview. Life is worrisome.* We are about to live the American Dream, which is, of course, to benefit from someone else's misfortune.* Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see. 4.5/5⭐️Synopsis-Sixteen-year-old Aza never intended to pursue the mystery of fugitive billionaire Russell Pickett, but there’s a hundred-thousand-dollar reward at stake and her Best and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to investigate. So together, they navigate the short distance and broad divides that separate them from Russell Pickett’s son, Davis.Aza is trying. She is trying to be a good daughter, a good friend, a good student, and maybe even a good detective, while also living within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.In his long-awaited return, John Green, the acclaimed, award-winning author of Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars, shares Aza’s story with shattering, unflinching clarity in this brilliant novel of love, resilience, and the power of lifelong friendship.Review-John Green is not my favorite author. Probably not even in my top ten. I’ve read quite a few of his books and liked them well enough. I bought this book for my teenage son because he really enjoys John Green’s work. He read it and said he was slightly disappointed in it and it definitely wasn’t his favorite Green book. Given our differing views on his other books, I decided to give it a try. I have to say this is by far my very favorite of his books. I connected with the main character probably more than I have any other. His portrayal of her mental illness was so spot on. And while I don’t have exactly the issues she does, I really connected with the parts of her suffering from anxiety and depression. The feelings of selfishness because it seems like everything has to revolve around you and your mental illness. The plot of searching for the fugitive did seem to stall out sometimes for me or seem a bit contrived, but the story didn’t even really need all of that. I found the story of Aza to be completely compelling without all of that. Just reading about her relationships and her struggle to try to be as normal as possible. I don’t cry reading many books but this one definitely had me tearing up. I definitely recommend giving this book a try. This novel portrays the social world of a high school junior who happens to be burdened with intrusive thoughts. The book provides an entertaining plot while also educating the reader about mental illness by narrating in first person the internal ruminations of a 16-year-old girl, Aza Holmes, who wrestles with obsessive thought spirals while also navigating the usual teenage preoccupations and struggles with dating, fretting about college, calming her overbearing mother, and appeasing her demanding best friend.The story is built around the premise of a news story that has recently been broadcast. A local billionaire has disappeared prior to a police raid on his house to arrest him for bribery and fraud. A $100,000 reward is offered for information about his whereabouts. Aza’s best friend, Daisy, remembers that Aza knows this guy's son, and she has the thought that maybe they can get the reward by reconnecting with the son to gather information that can be used to track down the missing billionaire.It's true Aza does know his son. She'd met him years ago at “Sad Camp,” a summer program for kids who’d lost one or both of their parents. Aza had lost her father; Davis, the billionaire's son, lost his mother. So Aza reluctantly agrees to pay Davis a visit, and the two feel a kinship of broken souls bonding. A sweet, conventional love story commences.But it hits a bitter-sweet, unconventional obstacle. Aza can’t kiss Davis without panicking because of all those microbes. “I'm not gonna un-have this,” she miserably explains about her condition. Still they bond. Meanwhile Aza and Daisy try to solve the mystery of Davis’ father's disappearance. But the real question in the mind of the reader is, how does this story end for Aza's relationship with Davis?The book contains numerous descriptions of what it's like to live with intrusive thoughts. The following is an example:(BEGINNING OF EXCERPT)Thoughts are just a different kind of bacteria, colonizing you. I thought about the gut-brain information axis. Maybe you’re already gone. The prisoners run the jail now. Not a person so much as a swarm. Not a bee, but the hive.(END OF EXCERPT)The above and many other uses of metaphor in this book attempt to describe the internal turmoil inside the mind of a person with an OCD diagnosis. Aza is self-conscious about her perception of not being a \\"normal\\" person even though her psychiatric therapist repeatedly says, \\"That's not unusual.\\"This book is marketed as young-adult genre but there's plenty of material here for adults to learn both about mental health and the world of social media, texting, and face time. In today's world it is realistic to expect a young savvy online snooper to be able to track down a missing person faster than the police.As it turns out in the end, they do indeed find the billionaire father (sort of), but Aza's relationship is such that she lets Davis make the decision whether to pass the information on to the police. And also the reader will want to know if their relationship continues in the end in spite of Aza's chronic OCD symptoms. The ending is realistic, not a fairytale, which is why it makes a good book for young people to read. \\"But I also had a life, a normal-ish life, which continued. For hours or days, the thoughts would leave me be, and I could remember something my mom told me once: Your now is not your forever. I went to class, got good grades, wrote papers, talked to Mom after lunch, ate dinner, watched television, read. I was not always stuck inside myself, or inside my selves. I wasn't only crazy.\\"As someone who has dealt with my own mental illness my entire life, I so appreciated the treatment of mental illness in this book, and the above quote explains why. Yes, this book is about someone with OCD, but it is not only about someone with OCD. It's about someone with a life, a whole life, and she's more than her illness, even when it is at its worst. Here's the thing: John Green is an auto-buy for me. I know there was a bit of over-saturation when The Fault in Our Stars came out, and some people have firm (and valid) opinions on Mr. Green. With John Green, I was a little wary because of the success of The Fault in Our Stars. Tbh how could he follow up? Well, he did. While Stars was an exploration of a visible illness, Turtles All the Way Down is an exploration of a hidden disease. I've been suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder for about six years now. OCD is a hard disease to find in media. When we finally see OCD portrayed, it's often the over the top neat freak stereotype (see Monk or that chick with Glee).Not this book. From what I understand, John Green suffers from OCD, which makes a ton of sense because he writes OCD exceptionally well. Like it was almost triggering how accurate Aza's thoughts were. Before I went on medication (s/o to sertraline!) I used to have the same thought spirals. The same obsessions. The same compulsions. I cannot overstate how important this book is for people who have OCD.This book does have weaknesses though. Outside of Aza and Daisy, the characters are pretty forgettable. The mystery aspect was a lot less compelling and exciting than I had hoped.But you know what? I don't care. This book is beautiful and haunting, and you should read it despite its flaws.", "polarity": "negative", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.4093887209892273, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	\N	2018-11-08 22:48:22.858135	2018-11-08 22:48:22.858135

I was looking forward to reading it but quickly became disillusioned. I'm from NC and have never heard anyone talk with the type of accents Ms. Owens chose for her characters. It seems like a small thing but it was extremely distracting, and eventually became ridiculous, especially because the characters somehow switched back and forth between speaking like Mark Twain's Jim to perfect English. It made me wonder if the author has ever been to our fair state. The story was good enough, albeit predictable, and it's obvious the author did her research on marsh life. I learned quite a few wildlife facts that were interesting. The conversations just kept me wrinkling up my nose with distaste and I ended the book on a sour note. I loved this book from the very first sentence to the very last sentence.The prologue begins in 1969 in the Marsh.  From the first few sentences describing it “Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky” you are pulled into the wonderful descriptive writing.  But then we soon learn that we are being introduced to the Marsh through the discovery of a body, that of Chase Andrews.Then we are taken back to 1952.  Kya, six years old, watches her ma walking away from the house.  She is wearing her fake alligator skin high heels and carrying a blue train case.  Ma always turned around to wave when she reached the road, but this time she didn’t.  That was the last time Kya saw her mother.As her brothers and sisters leave one by one, Kya is left to fend for herself.  Sometimes her pa is around and sometimes he isn’t.  Kya learns to survive in the marsh.I can’t even begin to describe the life Kya leads, without giving anything away.  I don’t want there to be any spoilers because it unfolds so beautifully in the book.The story is everything, heartbreaking, heartwarming, lyrical, moving, tragic and uplifting.  I fell in love with Kya, her strength, her simple goodness.Highly recommend.I received an ARC of the book. What a book for the senses!  After finishing it, I’m still so full of sights, smells, tastes, emotions; I think it will stay with me for a long, long time.  It’s a beautiful, incandescent story written with lyrical prose that weaves seamlessly from the past to the current time in which the story is set.  I was completely immersed in a marsh in North Carolina and didn’t want the story to end.  The ending...didn’t see it coming.  Just...wow.  The whole book is wow. Let me start by saying that this is the first review I have ever given.  I am a voracious reader and have over 5,000 books in my library.  I read fiction, non fiction, political, bios, horror, true crime, and everything in between.  I saw this book recommended on some magazine publication review, do not remember which one.  The plot sounded like something I might be interested in with intrigue, mystery, murder, and love.  I will admit that the narration of nature in the swamp and marsh does get a little redundant but  if you get past that you will find a book with a narrative hard to put down. You will feel compassion for the main character like you may have never felt before.  This book brought me to tears at the end.  I  recommended it as  a \\"must read\\" .  I don't think you will walk away not remembering KYA for a long time. Started reading it 10am and finished 8pm! Could not put it down. Main characters are easy to get to know (so you think) and the story draws you in from the start! I look forward to more from this author!! Read this Book! My favorite book of the year by far.  So beautifully written.  No skimming over sections in this book.  I devoured every single word.  I laughed, I cried (a lot) and most importantly thought differently about life - mine and everyone else's.  I became the character of Kya, desperately alone and forced to try to eke out an existence on her own in the marshes.  The marshes are their own separate character, but despite the fact that I am freaked out by insects and mud and most other creepy crawlies, I could actually imagine myself enjoying the Carolina experience, hard as it was.  You will root for Kya, I did, sometimes shouting out loud- You Go Girl!!!!!  I read this book in one day and can't stop thinking about it.  There are several clues to the surprise ending if you pay attention to the details.  This is a KEEPER! Wow! I just finished reading Where the Crawdads Sing. And I will say it again, Wow! This books is so filled with emotion. Kya, the main character, is trying to survive by herself from a young age. She has been abandoned by those who should teach her, guide her, protect her. She has to fend for herself.  Two men come into her life and teach her about the good and bad in life. I only keep few book's that I know I will read again. This is staying in my library. I am extremely stingy with my compliments for good books, but this tale is well-deserving of the praise. Of the last dozen or so books I've read, only two others earned five complete stars by me: She Read to Us in the Late Afternoons: A Life in Novels by Kathleen Hill, and Circe by Madeline Miller.I have to confess that I have also had magical moments with marsh creatures such as herons, eagles, and mud turtles. Like the main character, Kya, I am a compulsive collector of treasures from those Great Rock Tumblers: the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean which makes this book so attractive to me. However, Delia Owens' writing is more than just about the natural world. She spins a good and very well-written tale about murder, courtroom drama, nature, poetry, and even love.Another reviewer described Owens' writing as lyrical. It is. Take your time and savor every sentence. This is one of the most moving, caring, emotional novels I have ever read.  I read this book only because I had met Delia and have read her wildlife books she wrote with husband Mark Owens.  After starting the book this was all I could think about for days.  Kya's life become part of mine and the characters ceased to live on the page... they were alive with me and I was in the marsh, feeling every feather - the air, creatures and the plants.  Jumpin' became a trusted friend and so many moments touched my very soul.  I should not have been surprised as Delia has a great style in her wildlife books that I love to read.  But a novel like this is not my normal read.  Maybe I need to now reconsider what I choose as this book stopped me cold and made me rethink a lot that happened in my life.  Delia touched the human soul with her behavioral descriptions.  She is not only a respected wildlife scientist, she is a human behaviorist and understands more about the human condition that just about anyone else I know.  This is a tremendous treasure of a book and I'm sure it's staying in my read again list for a long time.  Highly recommend the book. Cynic that I am, with a finely-tuned Inner Critic always on high alert, it is often difficult to relax and read a book for pure pleasure, falling into the story, walking beside the characters, feeling their sun on my arms, their cold rain on my shoulders, and their emotions reaching deep and catching hold.  When it happens, though, I treasure the experience, and for days, sometimes weeks afterward, I regret my return to the less-than-magical, the more mundane, and too frequently, the patently awful, books on offer.A glowing review by a friend whose opinion I generally respect enticed me to try this book, one which is really not the type I would select.  But I was interested in the North Carolina setting and the premise of a “wild child” living alone in the marshes.  So off I went, nose in my Kindle.I read the book in two days, reading late into the night, snatching time during the day between work and chores.  Actually, the chores fell by the wayside, except for feeding my puppies.  I was mesmerized, enchanted, wrung out, appalled, energized, and amazed.  I dislike that last, overused word, but sometimes it’s the one that works.  And when I finished, I knew this was a book I’d read again, several times, and would not easily forget.What made it so special to me?  First, the writing: effortless, flowing, lyrical, and clear.  I absorbed it without stumbling, without mentally substituting a better word, or revising sentence structure.  Nope.  It was perfect for the tale being told.Second, Kya: a child of wonder, pain, abuse, abandonment, determination, beauty, the sort more from within than without, and a resourcefulness most of us cannot imagine.  Kya’s no cliché, no feral child just waiting to be rescued and rehabbed by well-meaning but clumsy individuals.  She transcends those stereotypes by leaps and bounds, and when she chooses to interact with others, she does so on her own terms. I also found the transformation, subtle and something easily missed if you’re not paying attention, of Kya’s speech patterns as she grew up, losing the backwoods twang and limited vocabulary of her crazy and largely uneducated father, for an almost academic style resulting from the stacks and stacks of books she devoured.Third, the setting: marshes that are hardly the monochromatic sweeps of green and blue so favored by weekend painters to the tourist trade; lagoons swarming with color and critters; birds far more numerous and varied than the ubiquitous seagulls; fireflies [although North Carolina folks call them lightnin’ bugs] flickering on and off with their special mating codes above the marsh; mud that isn’t yucky but the habitat of insects and worms; and the ocean, the largest body of all, rolling on past the undulating marsh grasses, the switchback creeks, placid lagoons, and sugar-soft strips of sand.  You can see all this, feel it in the blistering heat of summer and the chill moist fog of autumn and winter, smell the briny sharpness and the unmistakable tang of marsh mud at low tide, and hear the calls of all the birds, the waves rustling and then crashing, the wind making dead grass clatter.  And what about taste?  Well, there are all those grits, seeming years of grits…As always, other folks have provided the obligatory precis of the story, so go read those.  I’ll simply say that the plot is not trite, it’s not one you could predict, or want to, I suspect.  Neither are the characters in addition to Kya, even though one or two wear the clothes of a cliché until they morph into something else.Now here is the true evidence of this book’s power for me: I found some jarring elements, me, the reader who demands absolute historical, social, and geographical accuracy, and I just didn’t care. But here goes.The crawdads of the title are freshwater creatures, so they would not be denizens of Kya’s briny/saltwater marshes.  No one in North Carolina would call them anything but crawfish; growing up in Raleigh, I played with crawfish in creeks and streams.  Crawdad is a name used by folks west of the Appalachians.  However, crawdads do indeed sing, according to Woody Guthrie.People who live along the coast in North Carolina small towns would never go shopping can’t in Asheville.  True, you could drive from Manteo on the Outer Banks to Murphy in the state’s western tip using US Highway 64 the entire way, but it would have taken some 12 hours in the.  Thus the references to Asheville as a destination for shopping struck a wrong note.  So did having Kya’s meeting with her publisher in Greenville.  People flying in from Big Cities Up North would have landed in Raleigh or Charlotte.  Greenville didn’t have an airport in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Finally, I can’t find but one, possibly two, spots along the Atlantic coastline where Kya’s marsh sanctuary could have been located, given the detailed descriptions of boating through creeks and lagoons to the ocean.  That did make me wonder if the author used her imagination without the assistance of a few topographical maps.But you know what?  These minor quibbles aren’t worth a star, or even the point of a star to me, who is from NC, or to anyone else.  Such is the beauty and power of this story.", "polarity": "positive", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.994049072265625, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	\N	2018-11-08 22:48:23.330796	2018-11-08 22:48:23.330796

The actor however is the family patriarch, a war hero who returns to his farm, wife and children after being reported dead along the Bataan Death March. Instead, after escaping he joins Philippine and American guerrillas fighting the Japanese. So he is a war hero, whose return from the presumed dead thrills his family and hIs hometown.Yet when this prosperous farmer kills the Methodist minister in cold blood, the tragedy begins to unfold.John Grisham is not Willam Faulkner but he displays an ability to wrap a narrative with dark foreboding elements. This is no little feat. And The Reckoning discloses a side of Grisham only hinted before. If you love John Grisham's courtroom suspense, this book will disappoint you.  The pace is glacial and the unimportant details are endless.  The \\"mystery\\" is set up in the first chapter and not answered until the end.  I kept hoping the answer would be a surprise in spite of the heavy foreshadowing.  It was not a surprise.  The overall theme is that a WWII war hero is a slave to his masculine code, even when it will ruin the lives of every important person in his life.  A modern mind already rejects the early 20th century masculine code as paternalistic, unreasonable and ultimately selfish.  This book will set that opinion in stone. I love the thought of John Grisham and his rich Southern characters and the beginning of his books with the anticipation of a very good story.  Then it plods along and instead of developing characters and story it just dies a slow death with an ending that is abrupt or just boring.  I vowed not to read him again after The Confession which just made me mad that I wasted my time.  Obviously, I gave him another chance.. No spoiler alert except to tell readers, yes, you do finally find out the motive but by the time you get to it,  you know nothing could be as bad to justify all the suffering it caused. The best part of the book was the description of the Bataan Death March which was richly woven and worth the read... thus the 3 stars. Couldn't put it down.Very entertaining, read it in record time.Can't wait for the next bookThank you Mr Grisham I could not put this book down.  I have it on audio, and my husband listened with me.  He too couldn't stop listening.  I hope they make this into a movie. This is agonizing reading but I will not quit.  I should have read reviews before ordering the audible and Kindle versions.  What a waste of money. Enjoyed this book thoroughly! Grisham is a master and the Bataan Death March portion is maybe some of his most incredible writing. Ending was a bit of a drag though. John Grisham never disappoints.  This book was so awesome, I couldn’t put it down!  Read it in 2 days!  I would definitely recommend! This is very well written, but at times hard to read. It’s detailed but very sad. A completely unanticipated ending! It read really well with the suspense steadily building.  However it does not mean that there is not a surprise at the end. A m serious fan of John Grisham but this book falls far short of the standard set by his previous work. Dwells too much on background of the main character..Pete. Story-line is “stop and go”...jumps around too much. I always enjoy reading John Grisham.  This book was a little different than his other books but it was a fast read as always and both educational and entertaining. Think adding the \\"stuff\\" regarding experiences in the WW II was superfluous, not one of my favorites by Gresham. Book dragged on with a fragmented plot. Would not recommend . This was not a kind of story you normally write. The graphic description of the death march was so real. I lived through world war 2.  I was surprised by this book. I have read all your books. I am 83 years old. Please keep writing. I really wish you knew my story. Best wishes, Mary I've read every one of John Grisham's books and have never been disappointed.  The Reckoning is a great read right from the get go.  Again based in Clanton County Mississippi,  he tells a great legal story mixed with heroing stories from WWII.  I appreciate that while reading a great novel you also feel like you came away learning something.Great book! The only thing I did not like was a bit too much gore about the Bataan March. I have read every John Grisham Novel and this by far the worst.  Spends a great deal of time developing characters that seem to serve no purpose, and book seems to drag on.  This is just a horrible way to treat an honored war veteran that sacrificed so much.  I wished I had never read this book.  Jonh Grisham must thoroughly hate America's war veterans and heroes to think up such a tragic story.  I will make sure I wait after he publishes his next book until the book is thoroughly vetted before purchasing it.  I bought this one pre-release - what a mistake. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Reckoning. And although I had figured out the plot early on, I was shocked by the fate of one of the main characters.  Also fascinating was the author's description of the Bataan Death March during World War II. I'm a history buff and had relatives who had served in that war, ones of who came back with shell shock, known as PTSD today. So this explained a lot for me about his condition. Well written pablum set in WW2. Ending clear from 4th chapter. So disappointing. I have been a big fan and have read EVERY Grisham novel. This is just bad.  The story arc is so lacking in credibility.  How could Pete who suffered through what he did end up killing another for \\"sins\\" committed when he was presumed dead ? What allowed him to survive the atrocities of war would have allowed his mind to deal with an infidelity another way-- I think--- just did not ring true for me. The narrative was also lacking in tension-- very boring in fact, but I plowed through it.  I think Mr Grisham is definitely past his prime or just being lazy.  What a waste of printed paper! This is a great book by an equally great author.  Having read many of his books the first section was as expected.  I did not expect a section with the depth of detail about Pete's war experiences.  The third section was even more diverting and I couldn't put the book down.  I am a long time John Grisham fan and this book is at a new level.  For anyone that may have any doubts all I can say is you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend this for avid fans and as a great introduction to John Grsham's books. Book droned on and on, did not like any of the characters Pete the killer/husband of Liza the adultress, or their children Stella and Joel.  The book took too long to tell the age old story of pure as the driven snow  white woman has sex with black man and either cries rape or blames an innocent once she's found out.  Instead of black man being lynched, husband kills alleged lover.  OMG it went on and on so much so that I skipped to the very rushed and unsatisfying ending.  I have never read John Grisham before and thought this would be a good book to get a feel for how I might enjoy his other novels.  Not gonna happen. I love John Grisham books and was anxious to read his latest work.  The characters are nicely drawn andyou are pulled into the story and want to keep reading to see how it turns out.  Because it’s John Grisham, you expect some kind of twist or unique reveal that will be the payout for investing so heavily in his characters and their dilemmas.  Unfortunately the book is predictable and leaves you disappointed.  The big secret turns out to be what you expected all along and you feel that it doesn’t ring true to the noble-ness of the main character.  In the end you are left with some enjoyment but not the kind of satisfaction that would make you recommend the book to everyone you know who loves to read. A lot of long arduous filler to finally reveal nothing of surprise.  Dont believe the hype.  This is not his best work.  I feel more like the victim of a con job than a satisfied fan. This is a disjointed, dislikable book - a soap opera with some courtroom window dressing and the Bataan Death March thrown in for no apparent reason except alleged depth of feeling. The mystery of the main character is that he won't talk - a sort of misguided Clint Eastwood Man With No Name anti-hero. Not talking can work on the screen but does tend to drag on on the page. The wife does a bad thing while her husband is slogging around in the Philippines, although it isn't clear what that is until the end. Consequences ensue. The hero kills somebody else. The generations-old family farm is lost to a shyster lawyer. Almost everybody dies. Who knew what? When did they know it? Who was wrong? In the end, who cares? I can't believe I read the whole thing. A masterful plot construct of “What” followed by “Why” flavored with just a sprinkle of very dark WWII history. At first, I did wonder “Where is this going?” As usual, it led to a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. Grisham’s characters are so wonderfully created and so believable that empathy is instant. No superheroes. No blatant improbability. Just a very complex journey of the vagaries of life set in the rural south during the ‘40s. I was really eager to read this book, and hated it.  Long long descriptive passages about mundane things. So much dramatic build up about nothing. The war parts are appreciated but the rest was a waste of time witn unsympathetic characters. Time to find a new fave author. I've read all of John Grisham's books and this is the only one that I just didn't like. The main plot was interesting but the middle section (the main character's wartime experiences in the Philippines) was way too long and I kept wondering why it was necessary to the story. The ending did tie the story together, but, by the time I got there, I was just glad the book was done. Will go back and reread several of my favorites but this one won't be on that list. If you wish to spend at least 1/3 of the book getting a histoty lesson on Gen McAuthor and Japan's takeover of the Philippenes then you may enjoy the book.  I skipped over the large majority of this section.  The book also drug on and on in other parts.  I wanted to enjoy a thriller like the authors earlier books, not a sad, tedious and boring book like this one. this will be my last book by this author. I read all of Mr. Grisham's novels and look forward to each release with anticipation.  But none before have held my interest as much as The Reckoning.  My uncle through marriage is a survivor of the Bataan Death March.  He never spoke of his experiences.  Not a history buff, I had no understanding of the atrocaties  of this war.

You have the murder victim, another skanger (although a rich one) whose passing we need not mourn; you have the small pool of possible suspects; you have the manor house with the walled-in garden where the body was discovered. But an Agatha Christie novel might run 250 pages or so. “The Witch Elm” is twice that length, and I’m relieved to report that those added pages aren’t just filler.\\n\\nThey are, in fact, the core of the book, and what lands French’s novel in that twilight zone between mystery and suspense (where this book will undoubtedly be shelved at your local bookstore) and literature. It is a strange and rich territory inhabited by such novelists as Michael Robotham, Laura Lippman, George Pelecanos, James Ellroy and Ruth Rendell. All of these novelists (and a dozen others) have “transcended the genre,” as they say, none of them in quite the same fashion.\\n\\nThe fine-drawn quality of French’s characterizations is one measure of the novel’s above-average success as literary fiction, which is to say fiction that enriches our lives rather than just serving to pass the time on an airplane or in a doctor’s waiting room. I was especially taken by Toby’s cousins, the former wild-child Susanna and the twitchy I’m-gay-so-deal-with-it Leon.

But one could make the case that the divide has never consumed us as much as it does today. The political parties are aligned more than ever around blue metropolises and red spaces in between. Economic growth is now so glaringly concentrated in certain urban areas that it has reignited the age-old debate over staying vs. going. Should the young and ambitious from struggling small towns and cities be encouraged to seek their fortune in the hotbeds of dynamism and overpriced Sunday brunch, or does this only sunder family ties and hasten the collapse of the interior?\\n\\nIt was this dilemma that helped make J. D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” a runaway best seller in 2016 — the tale of a young man who’d overcome the dysfunctions of his transplanted Appalachian family to ascend to the Ivy League and Silicon Valley, with plenty of culture shocks along the way. Yet Tara Westover’s new tale of escape, “Educated,” makes Vance’s seem tame by comparison. Where Vance wrote affectingly of showing up at Ohio State and Yale Law with the limited preparation provided by his middling schools in Middletown, Ohio, Westover describes showing up in college with no schooling at all. Where Vance describes a family contending with the all-too-common burdens of substance abuse, Westover lays bare a family cursed by ideological mania and outlandish physical trauma. If Vance’s memoir offered street-heroin-grade drama, Westover’s is carfentanil, the stuff that tranquilizes elephants.\\n\\nThe extremity of Westover’s upbringing emerges gradually through her telling, which only makes the telling more alluring and harrowing. The basics are these: Now in her early 30s, she was the youngest of seven in a survivalist family in the shadow of a mountain in a Mormon pocket of southeastern Idaho. Her father, Gene (a pseudonym), grew up on a farm at the base of the mountain, the son of a hot-tempered father, and moved up the slope with his wife, the product of a more genteel upbringing in the nearby small town. Gene sustained his growing family by building barns and hay sheds and by scrapping metal in his junkyard; his wife, Faye (also a pseudonym), chipped in with her income from mixing up herbal remedies and from her reluctant work as an unlicensed midwife’s assistant and then midwife.\\n\\nDuring his 20s, Gene’s edgy and not uncharismatic intensity morphed into politically charged paranoia, fueled by what the reader is led to presume is a severe case of bipolar disorder. Around the age of 30, he pulled his eldest children from school to protect them from the Illuminati, though they, at least, had the benefit of a birth certificate, an indulgence the youngest four would be denied. In theory, the children were being home-schooled; in reality, there was virtually no academic instruction to speak of. They learned to read from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the speeches of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. The only science book in the house was for young children, full of glossy illustrations. The bulk of their time was spent helping their parents at work. Barely into her teens, Westover graduated from helping her mom mix remedies and birth babies to sorting scrap with her dad, who had the unnerving habit of inadvertently hitting her with pieces he’d tossed.", "polarity": "neutral", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.4322322905063629, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:48:28.183326	2018-11-08 22:48:28.183326

But one could make the case that the divide has never consumed us as much as it does today. The political parties are aligned more than ever around blue metropolises and red spaces in between. Economic growth is now so glaringly concentrated in certain urban areas that it has reignited the age-old debate over staying vs. going. Should the young and ambitious from struggling small towns and cities be encouraged to seek their fortune in the hotbeds of dynamism and overpriced Sunday brunch, or does this only sunder family ties and hasten the collapse of the interior?\\n\\nIt was this dilemma that helped make J. D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” a runaway best seller in 2016 — the tale of a young man who’d overcome the dysfunctions of his transplanted Appalachian family to ascend to the Ivy League and Silicon Valley, with plenty of culture shocks along the way. Yet Tara Westover’s new tale of escape, “Educated,” makes Vance’s seem tame by comparison. Where Vance wrote affectingly of showing up at Ohio State and Yale Law with the limited preparation provided by his middling schools in Middletown, Ohio, Westover describes showing up in college with no schooling at all. Where Vance describes a family contending with the all-too-common burdens of substance abuse, Westover lays bare a family cursed by ideological mania and outlandish physical trauma. If Vance’s memoir offered street-heroin-grade drama, Westover’s is carfentanil, the stuff that tranquilizes elephants.\\n\\nThe extremity of Westover’s upbringing emerges gradually through her telling, which only makes the telling more alluring and harrowing. The basics are these: Now in her early 30s, she was the youngest of seven in a survivalist family in the shadow of a mountain in a Mormon pocket of southeastern Idaho. Her father, Gene (a pseudonym), grew up on a farm at the base of the mountain, the son of a hot-tempered father, and moved up the slope with his wife, the product of a more genteel upbringing in the nearby small town. Gene sustained his growing family by building barns and hay sheds and by scrapping metal in his junkyard; his wife, Faye (also a pseudonym), chipped in with her income from mixing up herbal remedies and from her reluctant work as an unlicensed midwife’s assistant and then midwife.\\n\\nDuring his 20s, Gene’s edgy and not uncharismatic intensity morphed into politically charged paranoia, fueled by what the reader is led to presume is a severe case of bipolar disorder. Around the age of 30, he pulled his eldest children from school to protect them from the Illuminati, though they, at least, had the benefit of a birth certificate, an indulgence the youngest four would be denied. In theory, the children were being home-schooled; in reality, there was virtually no academic instruction to speak of. They learned to read from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the speeches of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. The only science book in the house was for young children, full of glossy illustrations. The bulk of their time was spent helping their parents at work. Barely into her teens, Westover graduated from helping her mom mix remedies and birth babies to sorting scrap with her dad, who had the unnerving habit of inadvertently hitting her with pieces he’d tossed.", "polarity": "neutral", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.4322322905063629, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:48:32.333423	2018-11-08 22:48:32.333423

Two more Osage died in the ensuing months, both of suspected poisonings. A couple was blown up by a nitroglycerin bomb while they slept in their bed. The killing continued, with more than two dozen people — not just Osage Indians but also white investigators sent to look into the crimes — killed between 1920 and 1924. It became known as the Osage Reign of Terror.\\n\\nThe second part of Grann’s subtitle nods to the fitful investigation into the killings and their role in shaping the modern F.B.I. In the 1920s, law enforcement was typically conducted by a patchwork of sheriffs, private detectives and vigilantes. The sheriff of Osage County at the time was Harve M. Freas, 58, who weighed 300 pounds and was rumored to cavort with bootleggers and gamblers. He had done nothing to determine who was killing the Osage Indians, so the tribe asked Barney McBride, a white oilman they trusted, to go to Washington, D.C., to insist the federal government intervene. A day after he arrived, McBride’s body was found in a Maryland culvert. He was naked and had been stabbed over 20 times. “Conspiracy Believed to Kill Rich Indians,” The Washington Post’s headline read.\\n\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation was created by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, to fill in gaps in jurisdiction and assist where local enforcement was overmatched. By the 1920s, though, it was still relatively small, with only a few hundred agents and a handful of offices around the country. Most important, the bureau’s agents were not trusted. Known for bending laws and getting cozy with criminals, the Department of Justice, Grann writes, “had become known as the Department of Easy Virtue.”\\n\\nThat changed in 1924, when J. Edgar Hoover was appointed the director of the F.B.I. He was not a likely choice. He had been deputy director under Burns, but was only 29 and had never been a detective. He was diminutive, struggled with a stutter and a fear of germs, and lived with his mother. But he was zealous and organized, and had a vision for the bureau. He insisted that all agents have some background in law or accounting; that they wear dark suits and ties; that they abstain from alcohol and be models of personal propriety; and that they use new, scientific methods of sleuthing, including fingerprint identification, ballistics, handwriting analysis and phone-tapping.\\n\\nThe Osage murders would be Hoover’s first significant test of the new F.B.I.’s abilities.\\n\\nGiven that so many investigators had already failed or had been murdered in pursuit of the killers, Hoover needed the sturdiest and most incorruptible of agents to head up the investigation. He chose Tom White, a Texan myth of a man. White’s father was the local sheriff in Austin, so Tom grew up in a home attached to the county jail. He and two brothers eventually became Texas Rangers. Looking for a more stable life, White became an F.B.I. agent.\\n\\nWhite was empowered to put his own team together, most of whom would insinuate themselves into Osage undercover. One older agent entered town as an elderly cattle rancher. Another agent, a former insurance salesman, set up a real insurance office in town. And John Wren, part Ute Indian — one of the F.B.I.’s few Native Americans — arrived as an Indian medicine man hoping to find his relatives.\\n\\nIf this all sounds like the plot of a detective novel, you have fallen under the spell of David Grann’s brilliance. In his previous two books, “The Lost City of Z,” about the search for the golden Amazonian city of El Dorado, and “The Devil and Sherlock Holmes,” a varied collection of journalism, Grann has proved himself a master of spinning delicious, many-layered mysteries that also happen to be true. As a reporter he is dogged and exacting, with a singular ability to uncover and incorporate obscure journals, depositions and ledgers without ever letting the plot sag. As a writer he is generous of spirit, willing to give even the most scurrilous of characters the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nThus, when Tom White and his men solve the crime, and the mastermind behind the murders is revealed, you will not see it coming. You will feel that familiar thrill at having been successfully misdirected, but then there are about 70 pages left in the book. And in these last pages, Grann takes what was already a fascinating and disciplined recording of a forgotten chapter in American history, and with the help of contemporary Osage tribe members, he illuminates a sickening conspiracy that goes far deeper than those four years of horror. It will sear your soul. Among the towering thefts and crimes visited upon the native peoples of the continent, what was done to the Osage must rank among the most depraved and ignoble. “This land is saturated with blood,” says Mary Jo Webb, an Osage Indian alive today and still trying to understand the crimes of the past. “History,” Grann writes in this shattering book, “is a merciless judge.”", "polarity": "neutral", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.7303565740585327, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:49:32.285966	2018-11-08 22:49:32.285966

Decades ago, as a graduate student in political science, she took an interest in the application of psychoanalytic theory to biography, as pioneered by Erik Erikson, among others. Although only her Johnson book trafficked explicitly in psychoanalytic methods and concepts, this education quietly informed her later work, which benefited from her focus on her protagonists’ upbringing, personality and human relationships. In “Leadership,” too, she renders her characters with a depth and intricacy that not all academic historians seek to attain. Her Lincoln, for example, suffered from debilitating depression, as we know; but she also reminds us that he developed a mordant wit that reflected a deep stoicism — and goes far in explaining why the weight of his melancholy didn’t derail his career.\\n\\nGoodwin sees complexity, too, in the beguiling Franklin Roosevelt, who, for all his cheerfulness, possessed a fierce, even ruthless ambition. Her account of his drive to conquer his polio so that he could traverse the Madison Square Garden stage at the 1924 Democratic convention exemplifies her talent at bringing personality to life not through didactic exposition but through well-wrought narrative. She describes Roosevelt preparing for his convention walk by measuring off the distance in his library in the family’s East 65th Street house, then digging into his teenage son James’s arm with a grip “like pincers,” as he practiced hoisting his inert, braced legs across the room. At the convention itself, Goodwin recounts the tension in the arena as Roosevelt triumphantly hauled himself across the stage, on just his crutches, to seize “the lectern edges with his powerful, viselike grip” and flash his beaming smile to the cheering throng.\\n\\nIn contrast, when Goodwin gets to her section on the four presidents’ emergency leadership, which should be the book’s pièce de résistance, she succumbs to the leadership genre’s vocabulary of self-help bromides and bullet-point banalities. Otherwise bracing accounts of Lincoln guiding the nation through the Civil War and Johnson shepherding the 1964 civil rights bill into law are punctuated by boldfaced, italicized subheads dispensing wisdom like “Anticipate contending viewpoints,” “Shield colleagues from blame,” “Rally support around a strategic target” and “Give stakeholders a chance to shape measures from the start.” These conference-room poster slogans protrude in the text like hurdles obstructing a runner’s path. They interrupt the flow of the stories while unfurling what are fairly self-evident, common-sensical streamers of advice.\\n\\nStill, it would be unfair to deny the value in thinking collectively about these four presidents, especially in these dark times. Because so much recent commentary on our presidents has been negative — remembering Lyndon Johnson only for Vietnam, Franklin Roosevelt for barring the gates to Jews fleeing Hitler, Theodore Roosevelt for his imperialist swagger and even Abraham Lincoln for the limits of his racial egalitarianism — we can benefit from reminders that even flawed mortals can, in times of national emergency, achieve great things. We can only hope that a few of Goodwin’s many readers will find in her subjects’ examples a margin of inspiration and a resolve to steer the country to a better place.", "polarity": "positive", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.5526829957962036, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:49:41.358934	2018-11-08 22:49:41.358934

I was glad to see the chapter on inequality, but I’m skeptical about his prediction that in the 21st century “data will eclipse both land and machinery as the most important asset” separating rich people from everyone else. Land will always be hugely important, especially as the global population nears 10 billion. Meanwhile, data on key human endeavors — how to grow food or produce energy, for example — will become even more widely available. Simply having information won’t offer a competitive edge; knowing what to do with it will.\\n\\nSimilarly, I wanted to see more nuance in Harari’s discussion of data and privacy. He rightly notes that more information is being gathered on individuals than ever before. But he doesn’t distinguish among the types of data being collected — the kind of shoes you like to buy versus which diseases you’re genetically predisposed to — or who is gathering it, or how they’re using it. Your shopping history and your medical history aren’t collected by the same people, protected by the same safeguards or used for the same purposes. Recognizing this distinction would have made his discussion more enlightening.\\n\\nI was also dissatisfied with the chapter on community. Harari argues that social media including Facebook have contributed to political polarization by allowing users to cocoon themselves, interacting only with those who share their views. It’s a fair point, but he undersells the benefits of connecting family and friends around the world. He also creates a straw man by asking whether Facebook alone can solve the problem of polarization. On its own, of course it can’t — but that’s not surprising, considering how deep the problem cuts. Governments, civil society and the private sector all have a role to play, and I wish Harari had said more about them.\\n\\nBut Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. All three of his books wrestle with some version of the same question: What will give our lives meaning in the decades and centuries ahead? So far, human history has been driven by a desire to live longer, healthier, happier lives. If science is eventually able to give that dream to most people, and large numbers of people no longer need to work in order to feed and clothe everyone, what reason will we have to get up in the morning?\\n\\nIt’s no criticism to say that Harari hasn’t produced a satisfying answer yet. Neither has anyone else. So I hope he turns more fully to this question in the future. In the meantime, he has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.", "polarity": "positive", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.9837387800216675, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:50:04.800544	2018-11-08 22:50:04.800544

They must draw information from the tiniest of clues. A few years ago, a German scholar spotted a marginal note that a Florentine had entered in 1503 in his copy of Cicero’s letters. On a page on which Cicero remarked that the painter Apelles “finished the head and bust of his Venus with the most refined artistry, but left the rest of her body incomplete,” the Florentine reader, Agostino Vespucci, connected past to present: “Leonardo da Vinci works this way in all his paintings, as in the head of Lisa del Giocondo and that of Anne, mother of the Virgin. We will see what he will do in the Hall of the Great Council.”\\n\\nThis little note confirmed that the subject of the infinitely mysterious “Mona Lisa” was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy silk merchant. It showed that Leonardo’s contemporaries recognized and discussed the special qualities of his art. And it gave a taste of the way in which Renaissance Italians creatively combined disciplines. Vespucci was a classical scholar, trained by the most brilliant philologist of the late 15th century, Angelo Poliziano. He used his training not in the academy but in Florentine government, where he served as the assistant to another great innovator, Niccolò Machiavelli. Vespucci was reading Cicero’s lessons about the ancient Roman republic to help him better serve the modern Florentine republic. In Renaissance Italy, cultural borders existed only to be crossed.\\n\\nWalter Isaacson follows dozens of clues to reanimate Leonardo da Vinci, one of the boldest of these border-crossers. Though Leonardo wrote endlessly, he revealed little directly about his inner life. Without fuss and without Freud — though Dan Brown, unfortunately, makes an appearance — Isaacson uses his subject’s contradictions to give him humanity and depth. A dandy, known for his bright pink clothing, Leonardo lived at times in rooms full of dissected bodies. A vegetarian who bought birds so that he could set them free, he designed killing machines. A connoisseur of grotesques, he painted glorious, glowing angels. As Isaacson follows Leonardo from one locale and occupation to another, his energy never fails and his curiosity never dims. Again and again he turns up a surprising and revelatory detail — the averted eyes that suggest Leonardo used mirrors to create a marvelous late self-portrait, human vertebrae drawn with precision and delicacy.\\n\\nLeonardo embodies the creativity of the “many-sided people” of the Renaissance” — the term that the cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt coined for him and his contemporaries. He is most famous, today, as the painter of the “Mona Lisa” and “The Last Supper.” Yet when he offered his services to the ruler of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, he promised to invent bridges, cannons and war machines. Only at the end of his letter did he mention that he could sculpt and paint. And Leonardo’s dedication to STEM subjects was absolute. In his notebooks, he recorded the movements of everything from the water in rivers to the blood in the human aorta (the patterns of which he worked out centuries before anyone else). He designed machines to lift huge weights and enable men to fly. And he made apparent that because he could draw these anatomical and structural wonders, he saw more and more clearly than professional scholars and medical men.", "polarity": "neutral", "subjectivity": "subjective", "polarity_confidence": 0.5517148971557617, "subjectivity_confidence": 1.0}	2018-11-08 22:50:08.130926	2018-11-08 22:50:08.130926
